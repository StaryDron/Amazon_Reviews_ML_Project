"I cannot express enough how pleased I am with this dog food. I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding.  For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems.  Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food.  After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me.  Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is.  I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority.  I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair balls.  I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go.  I highly recommend Newman's Own dog and cat food.

"Stash Tea Company Cranberry Pomegranate<br />Price: >$4 ordered in a 3 pack less than $10 (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046KO7JA"">Stash Tea Company Autumn Teas Trio Gift Set, 3-Ounce</a> + Free Shipping)<br /><br />Caff-O-Meter: 0mg<br /><br />Ingredients: Hibiscus; Rooibos; Cranberry Flavor; Pomegranate Flavor<br /><br />Received this as part of a 3 pack of teas for the holidays (Cinnamon Vanilla, Pumpkin Spice and Cranberry Pomegranate).<br /><br />-Smell (2) - The smell is not strong, but it is present. I am not a big fan of the smell of cranberry so that may be why the score is low, if you enjoy that smell you may be surprised.<br /><br />-Taste<br /><br />+Unsweetened:<br />++Hot (1) - Flavor is very bland, if not for the smell I would think I was drinking hot water with the tiniest bit of flavoring.<br />++Iced (1.5) - Tastes a bit better over ice. but a bit thinned down<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (2.5)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) bring out the flavors a bit more, again I'm not a fan of the flavors so that is apparent in this review but the sweetener definitely improves the flavor.<br />++Iced (3.5) -  Better over ice! The flavor is definitely brought out more by the sweetener, would certainly take this over a sugar laden ocean spray cranberry cocktail or something of that nature. I could even see using this as a mixer in some adult beverages the taste is there for it.<br /><br />-2nd Steep (2.5) - When the tea was steeping the second time I was concerned I was in for further disappointment, the color is certainly lighter but the flavor is about the same level.  I always rate this to see how economical a tea is.<br /><br />Summary - My typical everyday go-to iced tea is a blend of hibiscus (for the BP lowering qualities and taste), and other flavors, and I am on a rooibos kick as of late. However as previously stated, I do not typically like the flavors of cranberry and/or pomegranate therefore I would not ordinarily be attracted to this flavor to begin with and am only drinking it because it was included with my order. I will certainly finish the box, but I would not buy it again. If you enjoy the flavor of pomegranate and or cranberry you will most likely enjoy it, and I would certainly not discourage you from it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back.

"My dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy. She specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula. Unfortunately, my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy. I tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better. I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well. However, I can tell he doesn't consider it the most tasty of choices- probably because it doesn't have the artificial flavoring in it.

"I would have preferred them to have been made with stevia as opposed to splenda for ease of mind out of health concern reasons surrounding the safeness of splenda, but it is what it is. I also wish they'd come in glass as opposed to plastic bottles in these sizes maybe even flip tops because then they could have been recycled and used for wine or beer bottling purposes which would be great. As for the flavor I've tried 3 out of the 6 so far raspberry, chocolate, and caramel. The caramel has a nice aroma to me and tastes all right, but my least favorite so far. The chocolate seems to mix really nice with the raspberry and also seems to really stand out better to me in iced coffee. The raspberry was my favorite out of the 3 I've had the opportunity to try thus far. I think they are nice additions to flavor coffee's with, but you need to figure out the right consistencies on the amounts to use with them too much tastes a bit artificial and too little and it can be too subtle and difficult to discern the flavoring in them.

"I bought 3 doggy products at the same time (all treat dispensing chew toys). This is my recommendation of the best product of the 3.<br /><br />I bought the Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toy along with a KONG classic and Premier Tug a Jug for my 3 month old, 4lb Morkie. My dog doesn't play with the latter 2, but LOVES the twist and treat! It's easy to twist the top off and insert the treats and to twist it down to the size you want to get it to dispense. Smoothie quickly learned how to dispense the treats, so we have it on its tightest setting (puppy chow is pretty small, so easy to get out). He chases and bats this all over the living room.<br /><br />He played with the classic Kong once, but because it dispenses the treats so quickly, he soon lost interest and went back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />He tries to play with the Tug a Jug, but he can never get anything out and quickly tires of it and goes back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />Of the 3, the twist and treat gets the most use, its the easiest to clean, is hardy, has the best movement for him to chase around, & is the perfect size for a toy dog.<br /><br />So, if you're looking to keep your dog entertained, don't waste money buying a bunch of products, just get the twist and treat. Both you and your pup will be pleased with it.<br /><br />21 March 2012 Update<br /><br />I have since removed the back end of the jug and my dog will now play with it, in fact he expects for me to put all his food in it so he can chase it around and dig them out with his paws and nose.

"The Switch Orange Tangerine soda is an attempt to made a fruit soda with real fruit juice, real fruit flavor, and no added sugar.  They have mostly succeeded.

"I'm writing this review on behalf of my husband who is the actual Starbucks VIA decaf Italian Roast coffee drinker. Because of some health concerns he has been drinking only decaf coffee for well over a year. He recently had problems after having a couple cups of what was supposed to be decaf at a restaurant. We believe regular coffee was brewed in what was supposed to be the decaf pot. At a recent visit to our ""local"" Starbucks, which is 90 miles away, I discovered the VIA decaf Italian Roast and bought a three pack for him to try. He likes strong, good coffee and was impressed after his first cup. He took two packages to a meeting last night so he could have coffee, too, when the rest of the group was having real coffee and drank both of them and came home wishing he had more of the VIA. I've placed a pre-order for the 50 pack available through Amazon and from now on when we travel, he will be carrying a supply of decaf Italian Roast VIA with him so he will know for sure the coffee he is drinking is decaf.

I've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats.<br /><br />According to the can's list of ingredients, all the ingredients are natural - no by-products are used.  While the food is not organic, at least the food doesn't use by-products.  No wheat gluten is used either.<br />I went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor.  None of the ingredients come from China, which has a horrible record on food safety.  The cat food is made in  Thailand, but as far as I know, Thailand does not have a poor record of food safety, and Thai people do love their pet cats, I sure Thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food.  I personally see nothing to fear from Thai cat food.<br /><br />I think I will be ordering more Petite Cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends.",all four of my cats loved this canned cat food the food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the foodbr br the seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats neither flavor smelled bad the chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice ive feed my cats a few cans of each flavor and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well ive had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my catsbr br according to the cans list of ingredients all the ingredients are natural no byproducts are used while the food is not organic at least the food doesnt use byproducts no wheat gluten is used eitherbr i went to the companys website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor none of the ingredients come from china which has a horrible record on food safety the cat food is made in thailand but as far as i know thailand does not have a poor record of food safety and thai people do love their pet cats i sure thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food i personally see nothing to fear from thai cat foodbr br i think i will be ordering more petite cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends,5,0.015,Positive,0.0795454545454545,0.0454545454545454,0.0,0.2045454545454545,0.0227272727272727,0.25,0.0909090909090909,0.0227272727272727,0.034090909090909,0.2272727272727272,0,4,-0.21195395,-0.089733526
"It has been said, that dogs often show signs of their owner's personality and quirks---that our bad behaviors become their own.  In fact, my dog's Vet recently told me, that if he sees an obese dog, he can just glance at the owner, and they will often share the problem.  Not only that, but I've seen photos of dogs and owners, where I swear there was a shared physical resemblance.  What do we try to do, make our dogs into a little mini-me?  With this sudden jarring epiphany, I think we're in trouble here.<br /><br />Although my dog is far from a 'mini-me,' at 126 lbs and 30"" tall, given the opportunity to select a healthy, organic snack, over an inferior product, well...let me just make this analogy.  If I'm really having a craving for a snack, and there is a bag of Cheetos in the cabinet, I'm more likely to grab them, than the 'all natural' carrot sticks and celery in the veggie drawer. Enough said, and I clearly know better.  My Shepherd doesn't. He eats a high quality food, but I have let him dictate his treats, based on his observable level of enjoyment. In essence---we DO spoil our dogs, and ourselves.<br /><br />In test after test, given the opportunity to select the 'Newman's Own' treat, over my dog's favorite bargain brand---okay, Milk Bones, he would go for the MB every single time. But, toward the end of the bag of Newman's Own, I began to notice a change in enthusiasm.  Maybe eating healthy for humans and dogs, alike, is an aquired taste, or simply a change in habits.<br /><br />Will I purchase Newman's Own, after this trial? Absolutely! I'm sold on the all natural ingredients, the absence of chemicals and the product analysis. The only thing I found missing from the product description is the calorie count, with recommendations for appropriate number of treats, daily, which I think is important for managing weight. Although with the few 'natural' ingredients listed (Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Apples, Organic Palm Oil and Organic Molasses, preserved with Mixed Tocopherols---a source of Vi E) I doubt the calorie count could be that high, as these are not large treats.<br /><br />These treats are hard, and dense, which gave my dog a good dental workout, even with his mouth the size of a small alligator. Of course, it was gone in just a minute (but so is everything else), but smaller dogs would likely enjoy chewing on one of these for a while.<br /><br />I say, give them a try. You won't find anything healthier (per the product description), unless you decide to make your own dog biscuits, which many of my friends are now doing. But, doing so, wouldn't be more cost effective, because you would need to purchase all organic, while baking them in small batches due to preservative issues.",it has been said that dogs often show signs of their owners personality and quirksthat our bad behaviors become their own in fact my dogs vet recently told me that if he sees an obese dog he can just glance at the owner and they will often share the problem not only that but ive seen photos of dogs and owners where i swear there was a shared physical resemblance what do we try to do make our dogs into a little minime with this sudden jarring epiphany i think were in trouble herebr br although my dog is far from a minime at lbs and tall given the opportunity to select a healthy organic snack over an inferior product welllet me just make this analogy if im really having a craving for a snack and there is a bag of cheetos in the cabinet im more likely to grab them than the all natural carrot sticks and celery in the veggie drawer enough said and i clearly know better my shepherd doesnt he eats a high quality food but i have let him dictate his treats based on his observable level of enjoyment in essencewe do spoil our dogs and ourselvesbr br in test after test given the opportunity to select the newmans own treat over my dogs favorite bargain brandokay milk bones he would go for the mb every single time but toward the end of the bag of newmans own i began to notice a change in enthusiasm maybe eating healthy for humans and dogs alike is an aquired taste or simply a change in habitsbr br will i purchase newmans own after this trial absolutely im sold on the all natural ingredients the absence of chemicals and the product analysis the only thing i found missing from the product description is the calorie count with recommendations for appropriate number of treats daily which i think is important for managing weight although with the few natural ingredients listed organic barley organic lamb organic carrots apples organic palm oil and organic molasses preserved with mixed tocopherolsa source of vi e i doubt the calorie count could be that high as these are not large treatsbr br these treats are hard and dense which gave my dog a good dental workout even with his mouth the size of a small alligator of course it was gone in just a minute but so is everything else but smaller dogs would likely enjoy chewing on one of these for a whilebr br i say give them a try you wont find anything healthier per the product description unless you decide to make your own dog biscuits which many of my friends are now doing but doing so wouldnt be more cost effective because you would need to purchase all organic while baking them in small batches due to preservative issues,5,0.154495238095238,Positive,0.08,0.024,0.0,0.176,0.056,0.248,0.112,0.072,0.04,0.088,3,4,-0.4475595,-0.22126761

"I accidentally bought the large Tug-a-Jug for my little 12 lb Maltese/Jack Russell mix dog. Although it intimidated her as a puppy, she has since come to love this toy and begs to be able to play with it. (I wouldn't suggest small dog owners getting the large toy for their small dogs though. It works for Izzy, but my parents toy poodle won't do much more than sniff at it.)<br /><br />DURABILITY: My main concern with buying toys for Izzy is she can destroy most things in a short amount of time. Toys for ""aggressive chewers"" last a couple hours tops, and the only way I get stuffed squeaker toys is purely for her occasional entertainment. The Tug-a-Jug, however, has not been a problem whatsoever; it's still in great condition, and she's been playing with it for a year.<br /><br />TREATS: I would suggest when they're learning how it works, to fill it with treats like Premier Buddy Berries Dog Treats. They're a training treat and very small. Once your dog figures out how to work the treats out, fill it with something like Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats. These are larger and create a bigger challenge. Also, of course, dog food works great too.<br /><br />This is a great toy and option for dogs that have energy and enjoy a challenge.

"As I have with all other Earth's Best jarred baby food, I won't be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains ""trace amounts"" of BPA, but it ""doesn't come into direct contact with the food.""  That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing ""accelerated testing"" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).<br /><br />This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.

"So, I have an older indoor cat who has confined herself, more or less, to my bedroom, since our son was born a few years ago.  While in hiding, she put on a few pounds.  I got to thinking about this and the economy over the winter, and realized that it was better all around, to keep her healthy than to have an ailing senior kitty.  I did some research on what a quality cat food should be and came up with some qualifications and went shopping.  I returned with another brand- reasonably priced and fitting requirements.  My cat liked it alright.  And she lost some weight- fast.<br />  It was serious weight loss and I considered rethinking my own diet, but then we found she had fleas!!!  Poor thing had the worst flea infestation ever (ditto my closet and bedroom)!!!!  Apparently this can happen, even after ten years indoors, if outdoor humans bring flea eggs in on their shoes!!!  I'm told indoor cats often prove the worst flea sufferers- I believe it.  There is no where for them to run or hide.  The flea population explodes fast.<br />  She  dehydrated, anemic and completely exhausted, and dying,  I thought.  She had taken to staying on my window sill and would not touch the ground for anything (where fleas live), but of cousre that would be limitedly safe, too.  Well, I made some trips to the VET and pet stores,  and along with my flea aresenal I purchased some new cats foods to encourage her to eat.  I wanted  something with beef and liver, hoping  to help her get past the anemia.  Beef is harder to find than one might think, but there were a few, including Blue Spa.  I thought it a little expensive, but not when my first baby is so sick!  I opened it  first.  My desparate cat lept off the sill and ran to the kitchen- no lie!  It was the first decent meal she had eaten in days.<br />  Blue Spa Selects start with meat- be it fish, poultry or beef- not meat by products or broth.  The next ingredient is usually chicken and maybe liver.  After that is is a medley of nice vegetables and fruits and stuff-like sweet potatoes, wild rice, cranberries broccoli and blueberries.  The there's all the required nutrients and minerals and such. Sounds like a good meal, now doesn't it?  I admit, I found this concept a little over the top a few year back when I first heard of it.  But, you know, I have had cats who ate vegetables when the opportunity arose (I also had one who LOVED a nice coffee cake before company arrived).  When my sick kitty showed so much enthusiasm for this product, I realized that she must get bored with her food, same as I would.  All the good and different tastes in these little cans could be a new lease on life.  She is still quite thin, but gaining energy, looks good, and loves her new food.<br />  My only complaint is that the beef & liver variety is hard to find (not on Amazon, either, it seems).  We have tried the other flavors, now and they are equally loved.  Also- there's no ginger that I've seen, - a commonly complained about ingredient of a similar brand.

"Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />""Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation.""

"This is good popcorn, I have purchased before in Hawaii.  I was happy to see that I can order online.  However, I purchase the 20 pack and they overstuffed the box.  There is no bubble wrap or any type of wrapping around the individual packages before they put it into the box.  They choose a small box that can barely fix all twenty packages.

When we opened it, two packages had been damaged, and the butter leaked all over all the other packages.  We had to spend a long time washing all the packages, because they are all greasy.  The greasiness does not wash off easily even with soap.  Now when eating them, some of the other packages of popcorn got water in them because of the washing, they are not air-tight packages.

"I switched to mate from coffee a few years ago. I know it's generally an afternoon drink, but I drink it in the morning like coffee. There were a couple of websites where I bought it regularly. Unfortunately, Dr. Oz saw fit to publicly endorse it as a health tea, and the price went up everywhere, including my regular sellers. So I went looking, and found this on amazon.<br /><br />This is my favorite brand. The Selecci&oacute;n Especial is aged two years in special wooden boxes with vents to let smoke in. This is ""elaborada con palo"", meaning that it has stem bits in it, which makes the flavor last longer for more refills. Some will prefer ""sin palo""(without stems), because the stems also add a little bitterness to the mate.<br /><br />I understand that in Argentina, where mate is a common as coffee is here, Rosamonte is generally regarded as one of the best commercially available mate brands.<br /><br />Of this seller in particular, I can say that they were prompt, and that the box came with a couple free samples of flavored mate. A lot of people will prefer the flavored kinds, especially either ""citron"" which is lemon, or ""hierbes de monta&ntilde;a"", which means moutain herbs and tastes like mint.<br /><br />I, however, prefer this for day-to-day consumption. I run plain water through the coffee-maker, fill a large coffee cup about 1/3 full with mate, and just keep topping it up with hot water for a couple hours as I sip it through the bombilla.<br /><br />The main thing that pleased me about this merchant is that the product was considerably less dusty than what I had been getting from my previous suppliers. The difference is probably about handling and storage. The bags are like a bag of sugar, and a lot of rough handling could crush the leaves inside, creating dust. In the mate, dust gets through the holes in the bombilla and coats your tongue, tastes a little bitter, and generally degrades the experience.<br /><br />When it first arrived, I opened a bag and poured it into a big tupperware container that I use to store it. And I immediately noticed that there was very little dust compared to what I had been getting when I ordered this from my old seller.<br /><br />I'm very happy with what I received.",i switched to mate from coffee a few years ago i know its generally an afternoon drink but i drink it in the morning like coffee there were a couple of websites where i bought it regularly unfortunately dr oz saw fit to publicly endorse it as a health tea and the price went up everywhere including my regular sellers so i went looking and found this on amazonbr br this is my favorite brand the seleccioacuten especial is aged two years in special wooden boxes with vents to let smoke in this is elaborada con palo meaning that it has stem bits in it which makes the flavor last longer for more refills some will prefer sin palowithout stems because the stems also add a little bitterness to the matebr br i understand that in argentina where mate is a common as coffee is here rosamonte is generally regarded as one of the best commercially available mate brandsbr br of this seller in particular i can say that they were prompt and that the box came with a couple free samples of flavored mate a lot of people will prefer the flavored kinds especially either citron which is lemon or hierbes de montantildea which means moutain herbs and tastes like mintbr br i however prefer this for daytoday consumption i run plain water through the coffeemaker fill a large coffee cup about full with mate and just keep topping it up with hot water for a couple hours as i sip it through the bombillabr br the main thing that pleased me about this merchant is that the product was considerably less dusty than what i had been getting from my previous suppliers the difference is probably about handling and storage the bags are like a bag of sugar and a lot of rough handling could crush the leaves inside creating dust in the mate dust gets through the holes in the bombilla and coats your tongue tastes a little bitter and generally degrades the experiencebr br when it first arrived i opened a bag and poured it into a big tupperware container that i use to store it and i immediately noticed that there was very little dust compared to what i had been getting when i ordered this from my old sellerbr br im very happy with what i received,5,0.1010103383458646,Positive,0.0169491525423728,0.0508474576271186,0.0,0.2372881355932203,0.0,0.3559322033898305,0.1186440677966101,0.0338983050847457,0.0508474576271186,0.0847457627118644,1,0,0.42876256,-0.12886895

"If you enjoy pork rinds you are going to love this product. Hot and fresh pork rinds beat the socks off any of that bagged stuff from the grocery store that taste like steyrofoam packing peanuts. These little gems cook up light and crispy right from the microwave. They have a mildly spicy flavor that builds up as you make way through the serving but the heat never gets too powerful. The key to getting the best yield is to shake the bag before cooking. That will distribute the pellets evenly. Then you have to find the ""sweet spot"" for cooking time.

"My boyfriend and I received the Keurig Elite brewer as a Christmas gift after lusting after the brewers all of my friends and family owned.  We have been using a trusty Cuisinart 10-cup drip brewer for a couple of years now, and while it has served us well, it was a challenge to get a consistent cup of coffee.  Somehow we always ended up on either the too-strong or two-weak side of the line, despite our best efforts to be consistent.<br /><br />I should mention that we are students living on a very strict budget and we knew that the Keurig would end up being a little bit more costly than our Cuisinart.  But we really liked the idea of brewing coffee a cup at a time and cutting down on waste.  Thankfully, my generous sister surprised us with one for Christmas and it has really turned out to be a perfect gift!<br /><br />WARNING!<br /><br />I feel it is important to mention that we almost sent this back.  Considering how I've been singing its praises, I'm sure this is surprising, but there is something that ALL new Keurig owners should be made aware of.  The first maybe six or so cups aren't going to taste quite right.  Apparently this is a common problem.  There is a sort of plastic-y taste going on, even with coffees that don't normally have that fake finish.  It's the newness of the brewer.  Run five cups of straight water through it and then one cup of white vinegar to get rid of this problem.  I can't imagine how many people must have received one of these and then written it off immediately because of this issue.  It's a quick fix and a one-time deal, so be aware of that ahead of time.<br /><br />Now... as I was saying:<br /><br />The Keurig Elite is the entry level of the full size brewers (Keurig also makes a Mini, but we have friends who have had problems with that model).  It has a great water carafe that only needs to be refilled once every six cups (convenient!).  There is no digital display unlike some of the higher end models, but we don't find that a problem.  For those wanting to set up brew times in advance, though, that might be a make-or-break feature.  We manage just fine without it in our household.  It has the two cup sizes and, although they are only two ounces apart in size, the difference between the two can be quite dramatic.  I like a milder cup of coffee while my boyfriend prefers something stronger so I brew on the larger size while he picks the more potent smaller for his cup.<br /><br />When we turn the power on in the morning it takes about 3 minutes for the brewer to heat up and then it really truly does brew the cup in less than a minute.  SO convenient when you want to make a quick cup on your way out the door!  No muss, no fuss.<br /><br />We tried out several pods from the 12 k-cup sample pack the brewer came with (another bonus!) and since then we've also tried out a few of Keurig's other offerings.  It's really hit-and-miss in terms of what you'll like and what will be positively NOT your cup of coffee.  Here are some of the blends we have tried and enjoyed:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G"">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> - Our standard go-to good cup of coffee.  Nothing fancy or amazing, but consistently good flavor.  You can't go wrong with this medium roast.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KLM"">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> - An alternative to the Caribou Blend that might be easier to find in most stores.  One of the few Green Mountain cups that I've tried and enjoyed.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IPJTZE"">Swiss miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup, Milk Chocolate, 12-Count</a> - The only hot chocolate k-cup we've tried and enjoyed so far.  It is artificially sweetened and you can tell that immediately, but it isn't weak or watery and definitely gets the job done.  Tip: shake the pod before you put it in the machine to loosen the powder.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the Keurig and its pod system, however, is that the pods are wasteful and non-recyclable.  Very disappointing.  Keurig is reportedly working on making a recyclable pod, but until that comes out I feel a bit guilty about going through the pods so quickly.  However, there is a solution to this problem!  We picked up the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW"">ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> to use with our brewer!  And it has been perfect!  I'm Canadian so every time I visit home I pick up a big drum of Tim Horton's coffee (the best cheap coffee money can buy) and I can still use it in this little reuseable k cup.  Some reviewers had said that the ekobrew doesn't work with all Keurig models but I can attest to the fact that it works perfectly with the Elite brewer.  Apparently it is leaps and bounds better than Keurig's own reuseable My K Cup pod.  It's definitely worth the $10!<br /><br />Honestly, you really can't go wrong with the Keurig Elite.  We love it as a one-cup brewer without all the bells and whistles and we can't wait to try out the new pods we're set to receive from the included buy 2 get 2 free promotion through Keurig's

"Agree with other reviewers that PB2 is twice as expensive on Amazon so definitely shop around for better deals.  The texture of PB2, when mixed according to directions, is similar to natural peanut butter.  I add an extra 1-2 tsps of water to get a fluffier creamier texture and it doesn't water down the flavor.  It's not bad as a PB substitute and I really wasn't expecting it to be identical to the real thing.  The texture and mouthfeel isn't as satisfying as the real PB, but the flavor is fantastic.

"There are many reasons to reconsider the first foods we give to babies.  The jars and the plastic containers for processed baby food are often difficult to recycle.  The processed food and the dried cereals (wheat, rice, etc.) are nothing more than empty carbs for a society facing a massive problem with the rise of type II diabetes.  Is this anything to give to a 4 month old baby?<br />To complicate matters, the World Health Organization is now recommending that babies feed on only breastmilk or formula until baby is 6 months.  The reason is that baby's small intestines cannot process the iron out of other foods until baby is six months.  As any parent can tell you, by four months of age, most babies are wanting to try other foods.<br />Nurturme baby food can help with all of this.  Each packet makes up about 2.75 oz of baby food, the same amount in a standard baby food container.  The freeze dried food is combined with breastmilk or formula, so baby can try new foods like peas, apples, squash or sweet potatoes and still get iron a form they can use, while eating a nutritious veggie instead of a starchy carb.  I know carbs are important, but they hardly seem like the best foods to introduce when energy can be supplied from formula or breastmilk.<br />The different foods can be combined to make up baby food, for example apples and sweet potatoes together.  Another versatility option is to add a little bit of nurturme to babies bottle, sort of like a baby food smoothy.<br />The freeze dried packets are super convenient.  They are easier to carry around and store than regular baby food.  After baby is six months, if a parent wanted to add water rather than milk or formula, they can.<br />The baby food tastes good, too.  Normal baby food peas tastes like horrible canned peas.  If you ever wondered why baby wouldn't eat peas, try tasting that nasty food.  The nurturme peas actually taste like fresh peas (yes, i tried them for myself). I tried all four foods in this pack, and they all tasted like fresh food.  I think that having good tasting, healthy food would be much better to introduce than nasty tasting food.  I am trying to develop good eating habits in my child, after all.",there are many reasons to reconsider the first foods we give to babies the jars and the plastic containers for processed baby food are often difficult to recycle the processed food and the dried cereals wheat rice etc are nothing more than empty carbs for a society facing a massive problem with the rise of type ii diabetes is this anything to give to a month old babybr to complicate matters the world health organization is now recommending that babies feed on only breastmilk or formula until baby is months the reason is that babys small intestines cannot process the iron out of other foods until baby is six months as any parent can tell you by four months of age most babies are wanting to try other foodsbr nurturme baby food can help with all of this each packet makes up about oz of baby food the same amount in a standard baby food container the freeze dried food is combined with breastmilk or formula so baby can try new foods like peas apples squash or sweet potatoes and still get iron a form they can use while eating a nutritious veggie instead of a starchy carb i know carbs are important but they hardly seem like the best foods to introduce when energy can be supplied from formula or breastmilkbr the different foods can be combined to make up baby food for example apples and sweet potatoes together another versatility option is to add a little bit of nurturme to babies bottle sort of like a baby food smoothybr the freeze dried packets are super convenient they are easier to carry around and store than regular baby food after baby is six months if a parent wanted to add water rather than milk or formula they canbr the baby food tastes good too normal baby food peas tastes like horrible canned peas if you ever wondered why baby wouldnt eat peas try tasting that nasty food the nurturme peas actually taste like fresh peas yes i tried them for myself i tried all four foods in this pack and they all tasted like fresh food i think that having good tasting healthy food would be much better to introduce than nasty tasting food i am trying to develop good eating habits in my child after all,5,0.0792443667443667,Positive,0.0324675324675324,0.0259740259740259,0.0,0.1818181818181818,0.0389610389610389,0.3311688311688311,0.0454545454545454,0.0324675324675324,0.0194805194805194,0.2337662337662337,0,2,-0.12661622,0.1506012
"I can be a little timid when it comes to trying sugar-free products. Many leave that horrible aftertaste or at the least take some serious getting used to. But I gave these a shot because I'm not willing to consume 4 cups of coffee a day with each having an extra 70 kcal shot of the regular syrup. That's an extra 280 calories at the start of my day! But these were positively delicious with no bad taste or guilt from empty calories.<br /><br />So I gave the variety pack a go, knowing I was sure to find a quick favorite.<br /><br />My favorite was the Vanilla. Sweet and earthy just like vanilla should be. I will definitely be buying this one again.<br /><br />The Irish Cream was my second favorite out of the six. It adds an amazing creamy, buttery finish to each sip of coffee that you are sure to die for.<br /><br />In third, was the Chocolate syrup. I am generally not a mocha fan so I used the chocolate syrup a bit sparingly at first. But soon I was splashing in even more. It has a very gentle dark chocolate flavor without the bitter notes usually associated with dark variety.<br /><br />Next was the hazelnut. I am neither impressed nor detested by this flavor. It is a bit mediocre when compared to the more full-bodied syrups but will do in a pinch if you're craving that touch of sweetness.<br /><br />Second to last we have the Classic Caramel. This was absolutely disappointing. I hoped for hints of cream and brown sugar, but instead got a simple sweet syrup with hardly any actual flavor. It did the job of sweetening my coffee but did not provide the caramel heaven I desired. I have heard the Salted Caramel is much better, so that flavor has been added to my ""To-Try List"".<br /><br />Last is the raspberry, my least favorite. I am detested by the idea of fruity coffee (ei. blueberry, raspberry, etc.) so this was not a good coffee syrup for me. Instead, I decided to make raspberry tea with it. After several tries with black, green, and cranberry-pomegranate tea, I have decided this syrup just doesn't work well. As most of the syrups are made to add a subtle flavor to robust coffee, you have to add much more syrup if you want to actually flavor your tea. And all of that extra syrup just makes it way to sweet. This was also the only flavor I actually tasted that sugar-free aftertaste, though possibly because I had to use so much.<br /><br />It's hard to give a good rating for a variety pack as there are three spectacular flavors and three slightly disappointing flavors.<br /><br />Overall though I say this sampler is great if you're new to their syrups and would like to try a good variety of their flavors for a great price. But if you already have established your favorites, I'd suggest buying their 3 pack of a single flavor at the same retail-reduced price of under $5 a bottle.",i can be a little timid when it comes to trying sugarfree products many leave that horrible aftertaste or at the least take some serious getting used to but i gave these a shot because im not willing to consume cups of coffee a day with each having an extra kcal shot of the regular syrup thats an extra calories at the start of my day but these were positively delicious with no bad taste or guilt from empty caloriesbr br so i gave the variety pack a go knowing i was sure to find a quick favoritebr br my favorite was the vanilla sweet and earthy just like vanilla should be i will definitely be buying this one againbr br the irish cream was my second favorite out of the six it adds an amazing creamy buttery finish to each sip of coffee that you are sure to die forbr br in third was the chocolate syrup i am generally not a mocha fan so i used the chocolate syrup a bit sparingly at first but soon i was splashing in even more it has a very gentle dark chocolate flavor without the bitter notes usually associated with dark varietybr br next was the hazelnut i am neither impressed nor detested by this flavor it is a bit mediocre when compared to the more fullbodied syrups but will do in a pinch if youre craving that touch of sweetnessbr br second to last we have the classic caramel this was absolutely disappointing i hoped for hints of cream and brown sugar but instead got a simple sweet syrup with hardly any actual flavor it did the job of sweetening my coffee but did not provide the caramel heaven i desired i have heard the salted caramel is much better so that flavor has been added to my totry listbr br last is the raspberry my least favorite i am detested by the idea of fruity coffee ei blueberry raspberry etc so this was not a good coffee syrup for me instead i decided to make raspberry tea with it after several tries with black green and cranberrypomegranate tea i have decided this syrup just doesnt work well as most of the syrups are made to add a subtle flavor to robust coffee you have to add much more syrup if you want to actually flavor your tea and all of that extra syrup just makes it way to sweet this was also the only flavor i actually tasted that sugarfree aftertaste though possibly because i had to use so muchbr br its hard to give a good rating for a variety pack as there are three spectacular flavors and three slightly disappointing flavorsbr br overall though i say this sampler is great if youre new to their syrups and would like to try a good variety of their flavors for a great price but if you already have established your favorites id suggest buying their pack of a single flavor at the same retailreduced price of under a bottle,3,0.1072328944203944,Positive,0.0542635658914728,0.0387596899224806,0.0,0.1162790697674418,0.0930232558139534,0.2170542635658914,0.1162790697674418,0.1007751937984496,0.0232558139534883,0.1317829457364341,1,0,0.2689913,0.14990474

"My Italian greyhound LOVES these treats, and I've yet to notice any problems as described by so many other reviewers. My Bella (her name) gets one of these treats about every other day since she's very difficult when it comes to me actually brushing her teeth. They definitely do the job.<br /><br />Some people have stated that their dog has choked on these treats or a piece got caught in their intestinal track. Well, I'm not sure how fast your dog tends to eat treats, or how big of a chunk they try to bite off, but that DOES matter when it comes to digestion of anything. My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down. The person at Petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs. While I can believe that, my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day. If I gave her this for everything, I could see it becoming an issue.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are great, they help to keep my dogs mouth clean so that I'm not having to brush her teeth quite as much.",my italian greyhound loves these treats and ive yet to notice any problems as described by so many other reviewers my bella her name gets one of these treats about every other day since shes very difficult when it comes to me actually brushing her teeth they definitely do the jobbr br some people have stated that their dog has choked on these treats or a piece got caught in their intestinal track well im not sure how fast your dog tends to eat treats or how big of a chunk they try to bite off but that does matter when it comes to digestion of anything my pup eats these treats pretty slowly as i think she realizes it lasts longer that way and i make sure im in the room while shes eating it shell chew off small pieces to eat not large ones so im not sure if that makes a difference but i assume it wouldbr br i also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards to wash it down the person at petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs while i can believe that my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day if i gave her this for everything i could see it becoming an issuebr br overall i think these are great they help to keep my dogs mouth clean so that im not having to brush her teeth quite as much,4,0.0529247501469723,Positive,0.0952380952380952,0.0476190476190476,0.0,0.0952380952380952,0.0952380952380952,0.1904761904761904,0.1904761904761904,0.0476190476190476,0.0476190476190476,0.0952380952380952,3,4,-0.43436015,-0.24993622

"When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors. Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE"">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!",when we received our keurig elite for christmas we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors of the pods we had in the box four were green mountain coffee brand id never tried anything from this company before but from what i had researched online they have the largest range of keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as wellbr br unfortunately i was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee we tried their dark magic decaf and breakfast blend and all were underwhelming to say the least i was almost completely set on writing off green mountain altogtherbr br we had one gm pod left and being of the mindset of wastenotwantnot i figured id give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely and im glad i didbr br the nantucket blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee it is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent unlike some of the other gm blends we tried i added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our goto caribou blend pods almost all in all this is a very standard cup of coffee which while it isnt anything new or exciting is very pleasing and definitely one of the better keurig options weve been able to test out when we run out of all the pods weve accumulated ill probably pick up a box of these as wellbr br now that i know green mountain isnt completely disappointing ill definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbiyiegreen mountain coffee golden french toast kcup portion pack for keurig kcup brewers counta to try as well and see how it goes from therebr br if youre looking for a goto choice this is your cup,4,0.031038961038961,Positive,0.032258064516129,0.0483870967741935,0.0,0.0806451612903225,0.0483870967741935,0.2741935483870967,0.0967741935483871,0.0806451612903225,0.064516129032258,0.1290322580645161,1,3,0.31196588,-0.15748115

"We recently started eating more healthy in our household. We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones. We also switched to pasture raised beef and hogs. Once again, no hormones, no antibiotics, and no corn feed. What a difference in ease of weight control. Not to mention a lot healthier all the way around. So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles. Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise.

"I am always impressed when someone tries to solve an old problem in a new way. And I have never been happy hobbling my horse - I'd rather she could escape from a dangerous situation, and something unpredictable is far more likely to happen on the trail than at home. Sooo - here we have this device that is compact and weighs only 15 pounds, thus is easy to pack for trail rides. And since it operates on easily-obtainable D cells, no problem being ""off the grid"".<br /><br />The Fi-Shock HC-100 Portable Paddock showed up in a nice durable red Cordura nylon case. The long part contains eight molded, reinforced plastic stakes with foot push tabs to make it easy to get the metal spikes at the bottom, into the ground. Their working height seems to be just about 3 feet. Multiple slots allow a variety of configurations in set-up.<br /><br />A smaller bag attaches to the pole bag with snaps. It contains 100' of conductive tape on a reel (no, I don't know why the product description says 200'), the transformer of nicely molded, durable-looking green plastic, a transformer stand to be tamped into the ground, a shoulder strap, and two D cell batteries which I promptly put in a safer place so they couldn't accidentally contact conductive material and discharge.<br /><br />This proved easy enough to set up in an area that is clear of tall brush that could cause trouble when contacting the live tape. Properly set up, the paddock's batteries did not drain. Of course I carried extras. I also chose to guy the corners which I am used to with tents. Of course I had to bring extra rope and tent stakes for that purpose. No problem.<br /><br />This worked... for ONE not-huge horse who is trained to electric fences, so she doesn't challenge them.

"I have been giving this food to my cat for a couple of days, and I have mixed feelings about it. The chicken pot pie flavor has a lot of broth in it. Fortunately, my cat likes broth, and whenever I buy food that has either a lot of sauce or a lot of broth, my cat enjoys the extra moisture. However, this depends on your cat. What I found, however, is that the chicken pot pie has more broth than actual food.  The chicken is very chunky and looks very natural, and is exactly the consistency my cat enjoys.  However, it contains carrots, and my cat doesn't really eat vegetables. Cats in general don't eat vegetables, because they are naturally carnivores, so I question its inclusion.<br /><br />The Chinese Chicken is actually ""sesame"". It has a slightly odd aroma, which doesn't seem to bother my cat, and plenty of sauce, which my cat enjoys. However, the meat in this flavor is shredded, which my cat does not enjoy. It has fewer vegetables than the chicken pot pie, but my cat will barely touch the meat in this.<br /><br />From a nutritional perspective, these foods have about the same (or slightly better) protein content than my cat's regular brands. This is a plus, especially if you have an overweight cat. This food contains plenty of protein and plenty of moisture, which are really critical in quality cat food.<br /><br />Based on what I've seen, I would conclude that these are quality cat foods. They look better than what my cat eats on a regular basis. Ultimately, though, it depends what your cat enjoys -- consider the consistencies I've described before buying.

"The drink flavor is Kiwi Berry but I tasted a lot of flavors in it besides Kiwi and Berry. There are six fruit juice concentrates included.

Acerola (Barbados cherry or wild crapemyrtle per Wikipedia), Raspberry and Strawberry are listed as numbers 4, 5 and 6.<br /><br />I tried the beverage cold without ice then with ice.  Even drinking it a little later after it got watered down with the ice it was still a strong flavor and still tasted carbonated.  I noted that there was no aftertaste from Kiwi that I find in other drinks like Hansen.<br /><br />I don't believe the smaller size (8.3 oz.) was created for children, I think it is small to compete with the energy drinks out there that seem to appear in a similar size can.  HOWEVER, there is no caffeine, no added sugar, no guarana, or other ""energy"" added ingredients in this drink so it is safe for children and adults who do not wish to drink stimulant type drinks.

And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86"">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product. But I just don't think it warrants a higher price than the Optimum Nutrition protein.<br /><br />So, to recap, as compared to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86"">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>:<br />Pros:<br />Lower in carbs<br />Lower in fat<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive<br />Clumpier/harder to mix",the healthy n fit egg protein is a very good product its almost all protein the taste is good you can cook with it my favorites are oatmeal and russianstyle cottage cheese pancakes and the price used to be great even cheaper per ounce than the a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgistoptimum nutrition egg protein rich chocolate pounda however since i bought my first tub earlier this year the price jumped significantly to more than the optimum nutrition chocolateflavored egg protein so i bought a lb tub of that i found that while the on protein has a little fat and more carbs in it it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps unlike the healthy n fit product i also like the taste just fine so i found that i enjoy my shakes with the on more and its faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the onbr br please dont get me wrong this is a great product but i just dont think it warrants a higher price than the optimum nutrition proteinbr br so to recap as compared to a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgistoptimum nutrition egg protein rich chocolate poundabr prosbr lower in carbsbr lower in fatbr br consbr more expensivebr clumpierharder to mix,4,0.4162152777777778,Positive,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1842105263157894,0.0526315789473684,0.2368421052631578,0.1052631578947368,0.0789473684210526,0.0263157894736842,0.1842105263157894,2,2,0.05262431,0.13155644

"I have mixed feelings about NuNaturals Nustevia White Stevia with Maltodextrin Powder and will probably not purchase it again.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use, but it is just 6.4 percent stevia and 93.6 percent maltodextrin filler.  In other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder.  In my opinion, this is unnecessarily dilute; however, it does make it exceptionally easy to measure.  If the labeling said 6.4% stevia extract, I would have passed on this from the beginning as I can get 70% dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia. If this is your first time buying stevia, go for it as it's easy to use and tastes great.  If you're accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts, you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this product's mixture.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- 5-star taste<br />- Easy to measure<br />- Perfect for first-time stevia users<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Cons<br />- Only 6.4% stevia<br />- Not cost-competitive with 70% or pure dry stevia extracts<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Overall, a good product but not the best value.  I would given it 4 stars if the product labeling didn't try to hide the fact that it's just not very potent.  For about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of this product, you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low-cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead (or just use them full strength, which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia).<br /><br />In case you're wondering where I got the 6.4% (by mass) value from, this is how I calculated it.  On a precise scale, I found the density of this product to be 2.5 grams per teaspoon.  The label says it contains 40mg per 1/4 tsp.  Thus, 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder.  The concentration (mass) comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6.4 percent by weight.

"I think the Switch is a beverage with soda replacement in mind.  The can boasts it contains 100% of what one wants (being all natural, 100% juice, full daily serving of vitamin C, and the clincher, carbonated), while having 0% of what you don't want (no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives or colors.)<br /><br />The Good - So with that in mind, I have to agree that it is refreshing to see companies trying to fill the void in ""sodas"" with no corn syrup, with tons of juice and vitamins to boot.  I like that you get a full dose of vitamin C, and a little bit of A.  As for taste, it has a nice slightly crisp bite of carbonation, and it's very orange tangerine-y.  It's a little heavy (read syrupy without being too sweet), but it does have a reconstituted juice base, so it gets a pass.  It's also in a single serving-size can (8.3oz), which is nice considering I typically treat most 20oz bottles as a serving, even though it's 2 and a half and I tend never do the math to figure out the true content of what I'm drinking.<br /><br />The Bad - The price is a bit steep.  At about a dollar a can, it's roughly twice the price as most 100% juices you can find, including most selections of orange juice.  Whereas a 64 ounce carton of Tropicana will run you upwards of four dollars, 8 cans of the Switch would cost eight bucks.  For soda lovers, the Switch is about twice the cost compared to your average 20oz bottle, and roughly 4 times the cost of cans (when comparing equal amount by the ounce.)  Also, read the ingredients, it contains more apple and grape juice than orange or tangerine, which means that the taste is probably aided by the natural flavors (which doesn't mean oranges, just that it was derived from natural substances not chemically made.)<br /><br />The Ugly - The Switch seems straight forward, but it's also a little devious which leads me to my biggest complaint.  Granted it's all natural, but each 8oz can contains 36g of carbs, 34 of sugar alone.  That's more sugar than soda, in some cases by almost 10 grams a serving.  More sugar (even if it's not corn syrup) is more calories per can, so even at it's single serving size you'd almost be better off drinking a Coke and taking a vitamin C pill.",i think the switch is a beverage with soda replacement in mind the can boasts it contains of what one wants being all natural juice full daily serving of vitamin c and the clincher carbonated while having of what you dont want no added sugar corn syrup preservatives or colorsbr br the good so with that in mind i have to agree that it is refreshing to see companies trying to fill the void in sodas with no corn syrup with tons of juice and vitamins to boot i like that you get a full dose of vitamin c and a little bit of a as for taste it has a nice slightly crisp bite of carbonation and its very orange tangeriney its a little heavy read syrupy without being too sweet but it does have a reconstituted juice base so it gets a pass its also in a single servingsize can oz which is nice considering i typically treat most oz bottles as a serving even though its and a half and i tend never do the math to figure out the true content of what im drinkingbr br the bad the price is a bit steep at about a dollar a can its roughly twice the price as most juices you can find including most selections of orange juice whereas a ounce carton of tropicana will run you upwards of four dollars cans of the switch would cost eight bucks for soda lovers the switch is about twice the cost compared to your average oz bottle and roughly times the cost of cans when comparing equal amount by the ounce also read the ingredients it contains more apple and grape juice than orange or tangerine which means that the taste is probably aided by the natural flavors which doesnt mean oranges just that it was derived from natural substances not chemically madebr br the ugly the switch seems straight forward but its also a little devious which leads me to my biggest complaint granted its all natural but each oz can contains g of carbs of sugar alone thats more sugar than soda in some cases by almost grams a serving more sugar even if its not corn syrup is more calories per can so even at its single serving size youd almost be better off drinking a coke and taking a vitamin c pill,3,0.1106859410430839,Positive,0.0350877192982456,0.0526315789473684,0.0,0.1578947368421052,0.0526315789473684,0.3157894736842105,0.1403508771929824,0.0350877192982456,0.0526315789473684,0.087719298245614,4,0,0.25400275,0.07513939

"Is that these are 60 calories per serving, however, in all honesty, I didn't make it through a full serving.<br /><br />I was excited about these, they looked like a ""grown up graham cracker"".<br /><br />First problem was the smell. They smelled like melted plastic, and something else I'd hesitate to even guess what it is, but it's bad. I bravely pulled out one small crisp, hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific.<br />I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled.<br />Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously, it was awful.<br /><br />I tasted these about 45 minutes ago, and after drinking an entire bottle of water AND brushing my teeth, I CAN STILL TASTE IT.<br /><br />I'm glad these were an add-on, but they are still absolutely terrible.

"""Boylan Bottleworks""<br /><br />AS a charter member of ""Free Associators Anonymous,"" the company name is ripe with conotation: Pittsburgh. Giant pipes of metal and glass with sweaty workers downing a ""Boylans"" (or, shorter, sweeter: ""Hey, Trow Me a 'Boys'!""  Ironworks, manholes made in Oakland, tough immigrants, and cherries blacker than coal. Coupled with The Bottle Americana, even a non-serious soda flavor like cherry has a certain gravitas, a don't-screw-with-me style, even though I'm rich enough to afford this.<br /><br />Speaking of serious, let's get on with the parlor game of tasting notes. Boylan's Black Cherry, as noted by others, isn't too sweet (cloying as the wine connosieurs will tell you), syrupy, and it tastes like cherries, especially upon entry and in a very satisfying aftertaste. However, a grape/apple flavor sneaks in under all this, so much so that I was surprised that Boylan uses cherry juice only.  It keeps Boylan's from perfection, just as the Amazon price may give you pause.  (Trader Joe's does it again--will this company ever do an IPO so that we can all get rich off its well-deserved popularity.<br /><br />Back to Boylan again.  It's strong enough to stand up to ice, the fizz is moderate--you don't lose half your cherries to foam--and it's quite tasty and refreshing. Again, the only minor problem I had was the perception of a grape juice filler, perhaps my imagination, or perhaps a characteristic of one of the varietals in Boyland's cherry blend. The competition is from other designer sodas (Kemper's, for example), and from cherry sodas made with the artificial flavors and colors that we all grew up to love. At this price, it's a treat, and the taste is so good it'll disappear quickly, but you're a working man or woman.

"I am in my mid 20s, approx height 5'8"". For a good part of my college years I was 220-250lbs, I have since dropped down to 175 (weight loss not related to this drink). I began a rigorous workout routine once I reached my ideal weight to eliminate the love handles. Working full time and attending Masters Degree classes part time, with a few hours a week spent at the gym, really takes a toll on the energy level. Preworkout I drink Jack3d with A-Akg powder. That product let me tell you is the best thing since slice bread. I am big on Monster Absolute Zero, and if that is not available Monster Low Carb. So when I dropped by the Vitamin Shop a few days ago and the salesman who most certainly knows what he is talking about, dudes rock solid, suggested I try Celsius. Handed me 4 cans of this flavor, ""Sparkling Orange"". Upon initial taste results, it reminds me of Soda. I have not drank soda in upwards of 2 years. This brought all those couch potato memories back, till I rotated the can and read the ingredients. That quickly made the lazy days disappear once more. This drink is loaded with the energy stuff you will expect from a drink such as monster, BUT with a change of pace in taste. It does not taste anything like a redbull or monster or even rockstar, this unique taste separates it from all the energy boosters I've tasted in the passed. Long story short, this does pack a kick.

"My reason for the low rating is that there was no ""use by"" date on the bag, making it difficult to know if the beans were old and not well cared for or if that's just the way Tanzanian peaberry beans roast up.  Not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products, but this supplier has found some way to get around it.  The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste.

"The kiwi/berry soda drink was tasty.  I enjoyed the light fruity flavor instead of the intensity and heaviness of the popular canned cola drinks.

"Coconut Water with a splash of Pineapple<br /><br />This is refreshing!  It's sweet, but not too sweet.

"If you try to buy tea in one of our major cities and are approached by some limp-wristed purveyor trying to sell you one of his ""artisanal"" blends packaged in a paper bag with an attractive or colorful label, do not scoff but leave the premises in as diplomatic, and polite manner you can muster.  Tea has been and always will be an expensive commodity, and with good reason; its irresistible flavor depends on volatile compounds either inherent in the tea or added to enhance its finished flavor. The operative word here is ""volatile"" which is synonymous with ""fleeting"" and in the world of tea quality, packaging is everything. With Twinings tea you are getting a tea with the maximum protection; a foil-sealed metal can, for goodness sake.  Twinings delivers it to you with the understanding that you will enjoy the flavor that they meant for you to have so that you may return to them as a source of quality teas again and again.  Of course, once you've opened the can it's up to you to keep the can closed after use until the tea is all gone. I prefer loose tea and Twinings is my supplier of choice.

"My 19 year old cat was on a prescription diet for almost 2.5 years for his reduced kidney function. It was a great food, but the vet that carried it was 45 minutes away and my other 15 year old cat had loose stools with it.

"My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY"">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.

You can really tell the difference on teas like this one which use real bergamot, especially of good quality.

I think this is better for their teeth.<br />- Resealable pouch is a nice touch.<br />- Treats have no odor to them, even after handling them to break apart.<br /><br />Con:<br />- The package was a bit difficult to open - it has an indentation to tear, but the first side I tore did not open the bag. I was more careful on the other side, and tore it towards the zipper opening.<br />- The treat come in bunches of two, and since they are pretty thick (over 1/4 inch or so) I found it difficult to split them into individual services. Two would be too much for small dogs. However, if you have a larger animal they might be more appropriate.<br /><br />Summary: A good choice for dog treats.

But Lowrey's Microwave Pork Rinds are made fresh each time you microwave a bag. It's amazing how much the 1.75 ounce bag makes - more than enough to share.  If I have a complaint, it's that they are a bit salty.

"I'm not sure how you review something that's as subjective as taste, but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker, you'll like this (it doesn't taste exactly like either of those, but that's the closest analogy for me).  The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.<br /><br />Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.

"I like ""Vernor's"", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856.

"We recently adopted a new kitten. We rotate Felidae grain-free canned formula with Wellness Turkey canned food. He loves both and eats well, he's never left a single whole pea behind. This is a very high-quality cat food, using excellent all-meat proteins. He is healthy, active,affectionate, and has a smooth glossy coat.

"Lubeck Niederegger is the best, highest quality of Marzipan! This is a lovely gift-<br />highly appreciated. Keeps for months (keep it cool, OK in fridge).<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is like no other! Search them on the web for the full story. Highest quality Marzipan originated in Turkey, under the Ottomans. When the Turks came up through Europe, all the way to the Gates of Vienna, they brought Marzipan with them. -The Croissant bread (Turkish Crescent)  was developed to warn people the Turks were coming-<br /><br />The Germans, Swiss, Austrians, and Swedes are most renowned for Marzipan in Europe. Check out the Niederegger site -a nice site! Great site-learn about Marzipan quickly-nice story.<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is made with more Almonds, less sugar, filler than others. Simply, ground almonds, rose water, sugar make the best Marzipan.  No filler, no almond extracts.<br />Lower quality Marzipans need that since they have a lower concentration of almonds.<br /><br />With WWII, the Cafe Niederegger in Lubeck, Germany (East Germany for many years) was destroyed: 1942 ""The caf&eacute; was destroyed by bombing and the company's archives went up in flames.""<br /><br />Thankfully, the cafe  was rebuilt & this fine Marzipan is still available.

"Summary:  way too sweet, no berry/kiwi flavor, small serving.<br /><br />Upon first taste, both of us found this juice to be excessively concentrated sweetness.  Additionally, both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor.  Neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients.  It is made from juice concentrates + water to reconstitute, and the first two juices are apple and grape, so no wonder it tastes like apple (or white grape).  The mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice, which makes it have a very think and non-refreshing mouth-feel.  I think it needs more carbonated water (or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while), and it definitely needs more actual  kiwi and berry fruit flavor.<br /><br />Next we compared Switch Kiwi Berry to Trader Joe's similar Strawberry Kiwi Juice.  The Trader Joe's juice actually tastes like strawberry & kiwi, and is not too sweet, and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing.  So it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually good.<br /><br />Finally, it is in a very stylish slim can, which means that it does not hold very much: 8 oz specifically (the usual canned soft drink contains 12 oz).<br /><br />By the way, fruit sugar (fructose) is still sugar, and this drink is full of it.  When they say ""no *added* sugar"", that means they didn't add any *more* to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using, which is not the same thing as saying ""no sugar"" or ""no sucrose"" (table sugar).<br /><br />disclaimer: we do not drink sugary soft drinks, so if you do, you may like this one.",summary way too sweet no berrykiwi flavor small servingbr br upon first taste both of us found this juice to be excessively concentrated sweetness additionally both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients it is made from juice concentrates water to reconstitute and the first two juices are apple and grape so no wonder it tastes like apple or white grape the mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice which makes it have a very think and nonrefreshing mouthfeel i think it needs more carbonated water or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while and it definitely needs more actual kiwi and berry fruit flavorbr br next we compared switch kiwi berry to trader joes similar strawberry kiwi juice the trader joes juice actually tastes like strawberry kiwi and is not too sweet and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing so it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually goodbr br finally it is in a very stylish slim can which means that it does not hold very much oz specifically the usual canned soft drink contains ozbr br by the way fruit sugar fructose is still sugar and this drink is full of it when they say no added sugar that means they didnt add any more to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using which is not the same thing as saying no sugar or no sucrose table sugarbr br disclaimer we do not drink sugary soft drinks so if you do you may like this one,1,0.1513541666666666,Positive,0.0204081632653061,0.0204081632653061,0.0,0.1632653061224489,0.1020408163265306,0.3265306122448979,0.0816326530612244,0.0204081632653061,0.0408163265306122,0.1224489795918367,4,0,0.25964093,0.100044474

"I guess I'm in the minority, but I really didn't like these much. I was so excited for a cheesecake flavor when I saw it, but these were disappointing. The bars are super sickly sweet with a weird chemically fake vanilla-ish undertaste.

"Pomegranate molasses is my mother's ""secret"" recipe for great meatballs. She adds a couple teaspoon of molasses to the meat and the taste comes out incredible.<br /><br />Once I set-up my own household she gave me a present - Pomegranate Molasses of my own. I learned to use it in variety of recipes from deserts to meat sauces. It has a wonderful taste both tart and sweet at the same time. It has deep red color, and looks very appealing.<br /><br />It keeps almost indefinitely in the refrigerator. It blends well with walnuts, adds a unique flavor to beans, adds wonderful flavor to poultry, gives a nice taste to fish, gives an astringent edge to salads and vegetables, and is a great tenderizer for lamb and pork.<br /><br />I like its flavor even just diluted with cold water as a drink or adding tart flavor (and beautiful color) to sorbets.<br /><br />Ali Julia review",pomegranate molasses is my mothers secret recipe for great meatballs she adds a couple teaspoon of molasses to the meat and the taste comes out incrediblebr br once i setup my own household she gave me a present pomegranate molasses of my own i learned to use it in variety of recipes from deserts to meat sauces it has a wonderful taste both tart and sweet at the same time it has deep red color and looks very appealingbr br it keeps almost indefinitely in the refrigerator it blends well with walnuts adds a unique flavor to beans adds wonderful flavor to poultry gives a nice taste to fish gives an astringent edge to salads and vegetables and is a great tenderizer for lamb and porkbr br i like its flavor even just diluted with cold water as a drink or adding tart flavor and beautiful color to sorbetsbr br ali julia review,5,0.363235294117647,Positive,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.1666666666666666,0.2666666666666666,0.0666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.2,4,2,0.086272284,0.18197908

Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!

They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.

It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.

"My Dad has been a Yuban fan for as long as I can remember. The stronger the better! When you break the spoons stirring it, it's just right! He even goes so far as to plan his shopping and the stops on the trips that he takes, at stores that serve Yuban coffee. Why, I don't know, I'm a sweet-tea-ice-no-lemon guy so I have no opinion on coffee, Yuban or not, one way or another. I can say that it smells good brewing but then so does Play-Doh and some of the old magic markers. I'm just trying to report about what I've been exposed to.<br />Here I buy the packs of 12, every 6 months for him and give them to him at Christmas and Father's day. They stay fresh and save the public from being exposed to the mad, half-clothed emergency trips to the store that my 70 year Widower father makes to score the base component for his and the ""house guest of the moment's"" (see *1 below) daily ritual sunrise aperitifs. We've asked about his dedication to Yuban coffee to which he replies, ""it's perfect black, but better with something in it!"" He is apparently referring to its flavor when mixed with any of the typical 'southern flavorings' (taxed and untaxed, regulated and unregulated) that he occasionally adds to his morning brew. He is definitely one satisfied customer and it makes my life easier (one less present to find each occasion) so take his actions and my word for it!<br /><br />(*1)...If she only comes over for breakfast it sure seems like a long way to drive, and please, tell me again, why does she bring so many clothes?

"The seeds are fresh, the shells are hard and the seeds are JUMBO sized.  The taste is good, but the over-powering amount of salt ruins the experience.  The 'ranch' flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened.

"After reading the book ""Deadly Feasts"" I was horrified to learn what kinds of items may end up in my dogs' food! I started researching different dog foods and consistently received the same brand recommendations: Innova, Canidae, Wellness, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul...etc. I initially settled on Canidae, but also tried Wellness on a recommendation. The Wellness produced loose stools in two of my foster poodles, so I no longer use that brand. The Canidae, however, is perfect for my multi dog household, which often includes dogs ranging from puppyhood to senior status. The ingredients are phenomenal and, as all reviewers have said, the food contains no corn, wheat or soy, all common allergens in dogs. Although I also use and would recommend Innova Evo dry dog food, Canidae costs $35 for 40 pounds and Innova costs about $50 for a 28 pound bag. So, if you are budgeting a bit but would still like to give your dog the best, Canidae is great. After switching my dogs to Canidae, I noticed several things. First, my labrador retriever's coat sheen increased to the point of nearly blinding me in the sunglight; second, he lost about 10 pounds and developed greater muscle tone (although he was always fed recommended portions of commercial foods); third, my shedding dogs shed a lot less than in the past; and fourth, bad doggy breath is greatly reduced. I see no excuse not to switch your dog from a commercial food to Canidae or another super premium brand - it costs no more than a fancy bag of Iams or Science Diet, but can add quality years to your pets' lives! If you own a dog prone to allergies, such as a poodle, this food can't be beat. I had a family adopt a 5-pound malipoo from me and they emailed me to say they cannot feed him anything other than Canidae or he develops loose stools and needs to be taken out to the bathroom contantly.

"I eat these tuna cups (or the salmon cups) almost daily.<br /><br />If you're looking for a nutritious snack, these cups really can't be beat.  If you're a bodybuilder or athlete trying to increase your daily protein intake, these are awesome.  If you're a parent trying to get your kid to eat healthy, getting them to like fish is a great idea.  If you're trying to eat 5-7 meals a day to lose weight, make one of these cups one of your meals, the protein fills you up and makes you feel good.  It also requires a bit of chewing to complete the eating experience.<br /><br />Why eat a nutritionally empty ""100 calorie pack"" of goldfish crackers or potato chips when you could have something like this that has only 80 calories and infinitely more nutritional benefit??<br /><br />I'll eat these alone, straight from the cup, basically anywhere since you don't need to refridgerate and you don't need a can opener.

The package says ""in water"" but there's a little bit of broth in the cup, and if you squeeze this out or just leave it at the bottom of the cup, you probably cut the sodium down to 10mg.<br /><br />I highly recommend these tuna cups and the salmon cups as well.

"Vanilla beans typically run 6-10 dollars for two at major supermarkets.

I bought this kit and I have to say that it was a hit. It was originally bought for my wife but then she decided to trade off 15 of these for 15 of the White Zin that we were making for a friends wedding. At the wedding it went quick and many people were asking me to make it for them. MY answer was here is where you buy the kit and if you want to buy it and the bottles I would be happy to make it for you. I do not have a license to sell it since this is just a hobby for me.<br /> I did add one can of white grape concentrate after the F-pack was added and that added so much more flavor.<br /> I promise that you can't go wrong with this kit if you like a sweet chardonnay.,i bought this kit and i have to say that it was a hit it was originally bought for my wife but then she decided to trade off of these for of the white zin that we were making for a friends wedding at the wedding it went quick and many people were asking me to make it for them my answer was here is where you buy the kit and if you want to buy it and the bottles i would be happy to make it for you i do not have a license to sell it since this is just a hobby for mebr i did add one can of white grape concentrate after the fpack was added and that added so much more flavorbr i promise that you cant go wrong with this kit if you like a sweet chardonnay,5,0.262037037037037,Positive,0.0,0.0384615384615384,0.0,0.2307692307692307,0.0384615384615384,0.2307692307692307,0.0769230769230769,0.0,0.0,0.2307692307692307,3,1,0.08579463,0.022497058
"We have a 3 year old Maltese that we used to shower with Greenies (1-2 a day) even though it says to limit them to one per day.  The last time we took him to the vet, we told her what kind of food he's on and what kind of treats he gets.  She was concerned with the amount of Greenies he gets and told us to limit them to one every other day.  She said that Greenies contain wheat and that could be problematic for dogs later on in life.  So I searched on Amazon for a wheat free dental chew...<br /><br />Our dog has tried three different kinds of dental chews (including this one) and likes them all.  He's tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8"">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT18"">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a>.<br /><br />After reading mixed reviews, I decided to give these a try.  My first impressions were that these were pretty large for a ""small"" dog.  They are twice the length of a Greenie.  When our little guy got one, he ate half of it, then tried to hide the other half.  He did like it though.  I will say that he usually devours his Greenies but he takes his time on these (he did the same with the Zukes at first).  After a few days, he seems to really like them.<br /><br />If you're doing a side by side comparison between the Get Naked dental chew, Greenies and Zukes,  I think these are better.  They're really low in calories and they're wheat free, corn free, soy free and gluten free.  They're cheaper than Zukes as well.<br /><br />My recommendation is to cut them in half.  That will give you 36 treats for your dog per bag.  Three bags will give you 108 treats vs. Greenies 96 at around the same price.  He likes the Zukes but they are just too expensive seeing how you only get 15 per bag.<br /><br />I suggest buying one bag to see if your dog likes them.  If they do, then they are a great alternative to Greenies.",we have a year old maltese that we used to shower with greenies a day even though it says to limit them to one per day the last time we took him to the vet we told her what kind of food hes on and what kind of treats he gets she was concerned with the amount of greenies he gets and told us to limit them to one every other day she said that greenies contain wheat and that could be problematic for dogs later on in life so i searched on amazon for a wheat free dental chewbr br our dog has tried three different kinds of dental chews including this one and likes them all hes tried a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgukgreenies dental chews for dogs teenie pack chewsa and a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbmwrtzukes zridge mini carrot fresh breath dental chew bones count pouchabr br after reading mixed reviews i decided to give these a try my first impressions were that these were pretty large for a small dog they are twice the length of a greenie when our little guy got one he ate half of it then tried to hide the other half he did like it though i will say that he usually devours his greenies but he takes his time on these he did the same with the zukes at first after a few days he seems to really like thembr br if youre doing a side by side comparison between the get naked dental chew greenies and zukes i think these are better theyre really low in calories and theyre wheat free corn free soy free and gluten free theyre cheaper than zukes as wellbr br my recommendation is to cut them in half that will give you treats for your dog per bag three bags will give you treats vs greenies at around the same price he likes the zukes but they are just too expensive seeing how you only get per bagbr br i suggest buying one bag to see if your dog likes them if they do then they are a great alternative to greenies,5,0.1121938775510204,Positive,0.0833333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.2916666666666667,0.0416666666666666,0.0416666666666666,0.0,0.1666666666666666,3,4,-0.4629869,-0.13158211

"Right now I own 3 cats that I found outside, a good eight years ago, and I found another cat which I adopted also.  I have always fed them Eukanuba Adult Lamb&Rice dry cat food, and they truly LOVE IT!  When you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma!  Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau.  I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years.  They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it!  If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet!  They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food.<br /><br />The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food brand called 'Artemis'.  I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time.  One set of kittens were born outdoor and I brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on(they all lived to be close to 20 years of age) and they too ate Eukanuba lamb&rice and loved it!<br /><br />I have had foods that they turned up their nose with like 'Chicken Soup' and 'Taste of the Wild'.  The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes.  What's good for one cat might not be good for another.  You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them.  While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it.

I love the small packaging, portability, and (most important for me) high nutritional value. I also like that it has more calories than other brands when you compare serving size. That tells me that other brands are watered down. My baby is small for his size, so I want him to have more calories per feeding. I'll feed my baby nuturme on its own or mixed with oatmeal cereal. Either way, it's super easy to use. My favorites are the apple, squash, and peas which seem exactly like their fresh counterparts.

"Upon opening the sealed bag, I was struck by an unpleasant scent.  Looking at the ingredients I saw, in addition to the black tea and rosebuds, a ""natural flavor"" additive.  I believe this additive is the culprit to ruining what should have been a delightful bouquet to my nose.  Then I brewed this tea, and could still taste that additive, but overall the tea was tasty.  I hope the Davidson family reads our reviews because I am certain that, if they would just refrain from adding the ""natural flavor,"" I and others would find this tea to be superb, and in keeping with the other teas I have come to enjoy from Davidson's.

"I first ran across this wonderful stuff several years ago while visiting friends in California.  It was instant love!  I have of course not been able to purchase this product here on the E. Coast but friends living in California, traveling through that area, and indeed..every time I make a visit, bottles of this stuff wind up on my shelf.<br /><br />I use this tasty sauce on just about any appropriate food item.  It is a condiment I keep on the table during every meal.  Now don't think you are just getting a hot sauce here...no, no, no!  The flavor is what makes this the best.  The only sauce I have ever tasted that came near it was from two bottles of liquid heaven I purchased in Jamaica which is made and bottled by a single family their and is almost impossible to get.  This product though is almost its equal.<br /><br />The sauce is smooth with a garlic taste most certainly, but not overwhelming.  No edgy jalapeno after taste is present (Jalapeno are not my favorite, that's for sure). This product, as one reviewer her put it, does not focus simply on the burn as most of these concoctions do.  I am not sure what all goes in the stuff, but what ever it is, it works.<br /><br />This is the primary ingredient for a BBQ sauce I make (sorry, old family secret) and of course it works right out of the bottle on almost all meat, fish and many, many vegetables.  I personally do not like any sort of sauce on my eggs but I have many good friends that do and they rave about this stuff every time they stay over and I fix breakfast for them.<br /><br />If this stuff is ever offered nationally, I hope they do not fool around with the process too much.  I would rather it remain a bit hard to get than risk loosing this unique flavor.<br /><br />Trust me and give this stuff a try...I promise you will not be sorry.",i first ran across this wonderful stuff several years ago while visiting friends in california it was instant love i have of course not been able to purchase this product here on the e coast but friends living in california traveling through that area and indeedevery time i make a visit bottles of this stuff wind up on my shelfbr br i use this tasty sauce on just about any appropriate food item it is a condiment i keep on the table during every meal now dont think you are just getting a hot sauce hereno no no the flavor is what makes this the best the only sauce i have ever tasted that came near it was from two bottles of liquid heaven i purchased in jamaica which is made and bottled by a single family their and is almost impossible to get this product though is almost its equalbr br the sauce is smooth with a garlic taste most certainly but not overwhelming no edgy jalapeno after taste is present jalapeno are not my favorite thats for sure this product as one reviewer her put it does not focus simply on the burn as most of these concoctions do i am not sure what all goes in the stuff but what ever it is it worksbr br this is the primary ingredient for a bbq sauce i make sorry old family secret and of course it works right out of the bottle on almost all meat fish and many many vegetables i personally do not like any sort of sauce on my eggs but i have many good friends that do and they rave about this stuff every time they stay over and i fix breakfast for thembr br if this stuff is ever offered nationally i hope they do not fool around with the process too much i would rather it remain a bit hard to get than risk loosing this unique flavorbr br trust me and give this stuff a tryi promise you will not be sorry,5,0.1972431077694235,Positive,0.0169491525423728,0.0338983050847457,0.0,0.1694915254237288,0.1016949152542373,0.3050847457627119,0.0677966101694915,0.0169491525423728,0.0338983050847457,0.1525423728813559,2,0,0.16530994,0.12083693

It seems they produce one batch of light and one batch of full flavored and then mix the two. Are they expecting nobody to notice? At least my wife loves to pick out the light flavored puffs leaving me the full flavored creating a kind of bonding experience if you will, but if I were eating this by myself I'd be annoyed.

We use to buy them at the grocery store but found them on Amazon and it's a much better price!<br />Amazon was having issues with shipping and the crackers being very broken when delivered. I thought they finally got that better with more packaging but the last box I received was sent in the original box the crackers come in and no other protective packaging. Almost all of the crackers are so broken that it's hard to figure out what piece goes with what.<br />This new batch of crackers also has a very different taste. Much more salty and less sesame seed taste. When I contacted the company about the change in taste I was told: ""Nothing has changed other then we added vitamin E but that shouldn't change the flavor"". Well.... Something did and I let them know it's not the same and they never got back to me. I guess they don't care that their crackers have changed and customers will notice.

"Let me start by saying my 7 month old son, who is used to my home prepared baby foods LOVES this, as a once in a blue moon convenience meal! I've tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too. Rare in the baby food industry.<br /><br />I am following a weaning guide that I used for my daughter, and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland, watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made, healthy meals, resulting in picky toddlers and children. My daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet, and I attribute that to the hard work I put in in the first year. Another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs aren't fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger.<br /><br />I'd love to ask, who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets, though? My son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much ""fuller"", so I've had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume. And it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water, so I add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little. Before long, I'm sure he'll just be on 2 full 4oz jars when I give him this.<br /><br />All that said, I'll reiterate, it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food, and I have no problem giving it to my son once in a while.

"This is a great tasting tea. I know it is a very healthy and nutritious tea. But in order to have one of these a day I have to be willing to spend at least $60 a month for this tea.

I know people spend more at Starbucks for something less healthy but I just can't afford to have this everyday. I can use that sixty bucks for a lot of other things.

Me and my girlfriend tried it and it turned out great. She put some soy sauce in hers because she liked it better that way, but we both loved it. It did not have the fish smell after rinsing, nor while eating it. The texture is comparable to the rice noodles you find in Vietnamese and Japanese dishes. I am a convert to miracle noodle. I fed two people off of one pack, not bad i say. Also noticed the difference in the curving of my snack urges(didn't even touch my yogurt, orange, or nature valley peanut butter bar until near the end of my shift at work), and could wait longer before i took my lunch at work.

"To be blunt, I was throughly underwhelmed with this product and I am finding it hard to come up the words to describe why, but the problem is that orange SWITCH doesn't have a lot going for it, so there isn't a lot one can say about it.<br /><br />To me, this product is canned orange juice and club soda, packaged in a trendy little can.<br /><br />And like all canned orange juice (Blue Bird brand, et. al.) there is an off taste to it that reminds you it isn't fresh squeezed juice.

By the way, I also highly recommend the Roland White Miso Paste (incredible flavor and great quality) and the Ajinomoto Hon Dashi Soup Stock which I both purchased from Amazon.  If interested, my Miso Soup recipe is as follows: 1 package of Morinu firm silken tofu (this stuff), 2 tsp Dashi soup stock, 3 TBS white miso paste, 4 cups of water and 2 chopped scallions -- we also reconstitute shitake mushrooms, add dried wakame seaweed (highly recommend either Eden or Emerald Cove from Amazon as well), add shaved daikon, etc. However, this recipe is awesome just as is...

"I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack. This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat.

"The folks at Starbucks are not exaggerating when they say their French Roast coffee is ""Extra Bold.""  In fact, they should probably call it `Extremely Bold'...or maybe even `Ridiculously Bold.'  The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water.  The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long.

"As other people have noticed this isn't something that you should leave your dog alone with all day.  Given that caveat I think this is an amazing product!  I actually have 2 (one for each dog) and it is their favorite way to get a meal.  It keeps them occupied for about 10-15 minutes but you can tell they are thinking and having a blast and they are generally ready to settle down and relax for a bit afterwards.  I have one with a real rope and one with a rubber rope.  Each has benefits and downsides.  I would recommend getting the large even for little dogs, my sister had a 4lb yorkie and he has no problem operating the medium/large size toy.  My dogs are a 25lb cocker and a 35lb mix so I cannot comment on the appropriateness of this toy for large dogs.  If the toy is too difficult you can take the rope out until they get the hang of it.  Also my cocker will sometimes unscrew the back instead of working each piece out through the top but that actually takes him longer so I don't mind.",as other people have noticed this isnt something that you should leave your dog alone with all day given that caveat i think this is an amazing product i actually have one for each dog and it is their favorite way to get a meal it keeps them occupied for about minutes but you can tell they are thinking and having a blast and they are generally ready to settle down and relax for a bit afterwards i have one with a real rope and one with a rubber rope each has benefits and downsides i would recommend getting the large even for little dogs my sister had a lb yorkie and he has no problem operating the mediumlarge size toy my dogs are a lb cocker and a lb mix so i cannot comment on the appropriateness of this toy for large dogs if the toy is too difficult you can take the rope out until they get the hang of it also my cocker will sometimes unscrew the back instead of working each piece out through the top but that actually takes him longer so i dont mind,5,0.1043225623582766,Positive,0.1304347826086956,0.0434782608695652,0.0,0.1739130434782608,0.0869565217391304,0.217391304347826,0.1304347826086956,0.0869565217391304,0.0,0.0434782608695652,3,4,-0.42859918,-0.34221482

"Ghee is more than an indulgence. Ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement (albeit, one that tastes really good). Ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion, but it can be a healthy addition to any diet.<br /><br />Some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol.<br /><br />I performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available. I compared quality and value. Ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed -- especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used.<br /><br />The ghee comparison table can be found at this blog: [see link in comment]<br /><br />When I started this ghee comparison, I was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products. However, I learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards. It was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available. It is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on Amazon.com. (Grass Fed Organic ghee is one of those top picks.)<br /><br />Because such high quality ghees are available, I focused on understanding which product is the most authentic. Some of the ghees are much more authentic than others. The information in the table (link above) reflects that fact.<br /><br />The focus of my evaluation was not gourmet cooking. It was optimum health. Therefore, I was concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest.<br /><br />I rank Grass Fed Organic ghee as one of the very best products. Grass Fed Organic ghee is made in accord with the ancient traditions (such as phase of the moon, chanting, etc.). It is a great quality, great tasting product. And the good price makes it a great value.

"I consider myself a fanatical quinoa connoisseur, having enjoyed many varieties over several decades. NOW Foods Organic Quinoa is by far the best quinoa I have ever purchased. First, the quinoa seeds themselves are thoroughly pre-rinsed. There is no acrid flavor whatsoever. There is no impurity in this product. It is 100% quinoa. I do not know what NOW has done differently, but this quinoa cooks more evenly than any other quinoa. I mean, the seeds all cook about the same -- not mushy, not too sticky.

"This Chocolate Sampler Gift Basket arrived today, October 25, 2011.  I noticed, with delight, that one of my favorites was included....Chocolate Covered Peanuts!  When I opened the box, I expected to munch on a few.  Imagine my dismay when I discovered that everything had melted together in one BIG messy clump that was awkward to break apart!<br /><br />It appears that this shipment had been left somewhere warm, where the chocolate melted, then was placed somewhere cool where the chocolate hardened into a clump.  I haven't opened the other packages of chocolate yet so I'm not sure what I will find when it comes time to open them in subsequent days.<br /><br />Update on October 26, 2011:<br /><br />I opened the small package marked ""Kenzi Confections, All Natural Chocolate Napolitans Milk Product of Belgium"".  This small box was wrapped similar to a gift.  However, when I took the Kenzi wrap off, I discovered that it covered a box labeled:  ""Royal Orange Gelatin""!!!!  Inside was a handful of individually wrapped milk chocolate pieces which, like the chocolate covered peanuts, had been left somewhere warm, the chocolate melted, then was placed somewhere cool, and the chocolate re-hardened.  Unfortunately, this made these chocolate pieces look unappetizedly funky!  The lack of appropriate nutritional information on this particular package was also irritating.)<br /><br />Update - Thursday, October 27, 2011:<br /><br />Opened the package marked ""Kenzi Confections, All Natural Chocolate Napolitans Dark, Product of Belgium"" and discovered that it actually covered a box labeled ""Nestle Raisinets"", which made it IMPOSSIBLE to know the appropriate nutritional information on this handful of candy.  These also had been melted and re-hardened just like the other candies which caused them to look just as funky.<br /><br />No Pun Intended but wrapping up my reviews - regarding the Kenzi Confections inside other boxes such as Goya Spanish Flan Style Custard and Kellog's Fruit Loops is off-putting.  Makes me question the viability of the Kenzi Confection Company and why they can't afford their own packaging.<br /><br />The Lindt Lindor Mint Chocolate Truffles could have been better if they had not been melted first.  The filling inside had oozed out during the melt which resulted in a messy unwrapping that was not fully anticipated.<br /><br />The last, large, box looks suspiciously like a Kenzi Confection product because of the way it is ""wrapped"" with a label stating:  ""Life is Like a Box of Chocolates"", a well-known quote from the film ""Forrest Gump"".  As of this writing, on October 30, 2011, I am about to open it to see what damage has been delivered.<br /><br />Update = Wednesday, November 30, 2011<br /><br />This evening, I received the official gift basket with a note that what I previously received was a prototype that should never have been released to the general public.  This official gift basket looks better than what I got about a month ago.  The chocolate covered peanuts are MUCH better this time around!  I'll still need to check the rest of the candies in the coming days.<br /><br />Update = Tuesday,December 6, 2011<br /><br />I've been sampling the new basket that I received and have been enjoying the chocolates this time around.  I have two more boxes left to taste, within the basket, and I'm looking forward to that.<br /><br />Update = Wednesday, December 7, 2011<br /><br />The final box I sampled was labeled:  ""Life is Like a Box of Chocolate"", like the line from the movie ""Forrest Gump"".  This box included candies such as salted(?!?) caramel, chocolate covered pretzel, chocolate covered graham cracker, chocolate marshmallow cups, chocolate peanut butter cups, and small biscuit/cookies with chocolate on the bottom.<br /><br />Others might like these.  The marshmallow cups didn't impress me much as I'm not into that kind of candy.

I also put oven fried potatoes in at about the same time.  Then I make a salad to compromise toward a more healthy meal.  It's quick, easy and fairly healthy.  No it's not diet food but it doesn't taste like diet food either.  I just bought a case of Oven Fry from Amazon and am a repeat customer. It has become more and more difficult to find their fish product in supermarkets.

"This freeze dried ice cream is great! It tastes exactly like the more expensive kind with the astronaut on the package, for a fraction of the price. After receiving this, I understand why it costs less than the ""astronaut"" kind. The packaging stinks on ice.<br /><br />Normally, freeze dried items are packaged in air tight, foil type packages, so as to not permit light, and most importantly, air into the package. Air is the enemy of freeze dried items, because it contains moisture. The product arrives it is in an air tight can, which you need to open with a can opener. Inside, the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will NOT keep air out of the product.<br /><br />It gets worse. The paper wrappers are not only NOT air tight, but they are also ALL slit open. Every serving is slit open in several places. The can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible. This may or may not keep the product fresh, but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can.<br /><br />With mine, I got as much air out of the bag as I could, by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw. I then sucked the air out until I could get no more air out, then slipped the straw out, whilst closing the bag in one swift motion. You MUST do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving, or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream.

"One of my favorite salad recipes I make often calls for walnut oil.  I bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over $10 for about 6 ounces.  Steep!  I love walnuts so naturally I loved this oil from my very first taste.  But the price was not right so I searched on the Internet and found this.  I was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as I thought they go rancid before I can finish but I am now on my last can.  I use it in place of EVOO to make other vinaigrettes too.  Or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and B&S (or seasons salt like Krazy Salt) over spring mix, it is an easy but great green salad! I do this a lot when I need a quick side. Anyway, this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty.

"I bought this seasoning because Amazon stopped selling the 12 count Konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count.  I bought it thinking it would be similar to the Konriko, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!<br /><br />First of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows:  hydrolyzed soy protein, and Partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil.  I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it's a industry way of adding MSG.  Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.

I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.

After waiting a month for this product to reach me (20 days before they even shipped it!) I finally found it on my doorstep.<br /><br />Upon opening the box my hopes lifted even higher; these are solid little cups of a much higher quality than I expected. I filled one and snapped the lid down. I ensured it was sealed all the way around, placed it in my Kuerig, and hit the brew button. At first it seemed to be working splendidly then coffee began pouring out of places it isn't supposed to. By the time it was over I had quite a mess to clean up.

"For some reason, the stores around me stopped having these.  I use this type of bag for a few things in my life: camping gear (sleeping bag, hammock/tent) is able to breathe without being all over the place, storage of down comforter during summer, etc.  Then I got the great idea of using them for my recycling.  What a change in life this has been.  For three years, we've had to take moldy cans to the recycle center to redeem all our beer cans for the 5¢ apiece.  The little sips of beer in each can accumulate, and get trapped in a plastic bag, so I took my recycle cans and drilled holes in the bottom for drainage, then I line them with these bad boys.  The beer leaks right out, and when they're full, they're dry and while they smell slightly of stale beer, the change to that from stale wet beer and mold is incredible.<br /><br />Would I trust them for laundry?  Probably not if I had to carry it any distance.  They're mesh bags.  Going up or down stair or across the house is probably not a big deal.

"This is the second bag of coffee I have purchased from Coffee Bean Direct and they get a 100% approval rating from me! The prices really are great, and with the Amazon Prime shipping- the overall price truly can't be beaten. I love french roasted coffee- and this does not disappoint. If you do not like the smokey taste, then simply, do not buy any coffee that has the term ""french roast"" on the package!<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect from a Papua New Guinean coffee, and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a smokey, chocolate-cream taste. If it were a wine, it would be a Pinotage!<br /><br />Coffee Bean Direct roasts their beans fresh to order. When I purchased the first 5-pounder in February ('11) of the Brazilian French Roast, it had a roasting date of a few weeks earlier in January. On this package that I ordered in June, it also had the roasting date of January. So, it appears that Amazon is selling a large shipment they acquired from them months ago- be informed of that possibility.<br /><br />I have seen many people concerned about the five pounds not staying fresh once opened. Whatever you do- DO NOT REFRIGERATE OR FREEZE- that is some sort of urban legend/myth (lol) and actually speeds up the stale taste!  This is an easy fix!- Do what all coffee distributors do: store in a vacuum-sealed foil package. How? For the five pound bag, you will need about 10 gallon-sized VACUUM food storage bags (found in supermarket) and basic aluminum foil (also in supermarket.)<br /><br />1)Rip off one sheet of aluminum foil about 12-16 inches long<br />2)Lay foil flat on counter<br />3)Gently pour, roughly, 1/2 pound of coffee beans into the center of the foil sheet<br />4)Fold both of the width-side edges neatly over the center of the beans<br />5)Fold the length-side edges neatly over the top and towards the center (much like sloppily wrapping a rectangular present)<br />6)Place this foil package in the vacuum food storage bag- making sure that longer portion of the foil package is put in the bag parallel to the seal of the bag, which would leave much empty space between the foil package and the top of the bag.<br />7)Seal the bag, then vacuum-seal the bag by using the hand pump (can be purchased with the vacuum bags)<br />8)Do this with the remaining coffee beans (leave the amount of beans in the bottom of the coffee bag that you will be using within the next few days)<br />9)Check each plastic bag, by using the pump again to make sure they are vacuum packed.<br />10) Place each bag neatly and carefully either in a box, or a canvas bag (or some sort of storage to keep light out)<br />11) Store in a room temperature closet (about 60-75 degrees F)- making sure the bags will not be moved around too much or dropped as the vacuum seal could break.<br />12) Check the vacuum seal periodically and re-pump if necessary<br />13) This coffee will stay fresh for months this way!<br /><br />May seem like a bit of work, and adds to the cost with the price of the vacuum food storage bags- but, it's worth it!",this is the second bag of coffee i have purchased from coffee bean direct and they get a approval rating from me the prices really are great and with the amazon prime shipping the overall price truly cant be beaten i love french roasted coffee and this does not disappoint if you do not like the smokey taste then simply do not buy any coffee that has the term french roast on the packagebr br i didnt know what to expect from a papua new guinean coffee and i was pleasantly surprised it has a smokey chocolatecream taste if it were a wine it would be a pinotagebr br coffee bean direct roasts their beans fresh to order when i purchased the first pounder in february of the brazilian french roast it had a roasting date of a few weeks earlier in january on this package that i ordered in june it also had the roasting date of january so it appears that amazon is selling a large shipment they acquired from them months ago be informed of that possibilitybr br i have seen many people concerned about the five pounds not staying fresh once opened whatever you do do not refrigerate or freeze that is some sort of urban legendmyth lol and actually speeds up the stale taste this is an easy fix do what all coffee distributors do store in a vacuumsealed foil package how for the five pound bag you will need about gallonsized vacuum food storage bags found in supermarket and basic aluminum foil also in supermarketbr br rip off one sheet of aluminum foil about inches longbr lay foil flat on counterbr gently pour roughly pound of coffee beans into the center of the foil sheetbr fold both of the widthside edges neatly over the center of the beansbr fold the lengthside edges neatly over the top and towards the center much like sloppily wrapping a rectangular presentbr place this foil package in the vacuum food storage bag making sure that longer portion of the foil package is put in the bag parallel to the seal of the bag which would leave much empty space between the foil package and the top of the bagbr seal the bag then vacuumseal the bag by using the hand pump can be purchased with the vacuum bagsbr do this with the remaining coffee beans leave the amount of beans in the bottom of the coffee bag that you will be using within the next few daysbr check each plastic bag by using the pump again to make sure they are vacuum packedbr place each bag neatly and carefully either in a box or a canvas bag or some sort of storage to keep light outbr store in a room temperature closet about degrees f making sure the bags will not be moved around too much or dropped as the vacuum seal could breakbr check the vacuum seal periodically and repump if necessarybr this coffee will stay fresh for months this waybr br may seem like a bit of work and adds to the cost with the price of the vacuum food storage bags but its worth it,5,0.1242542306178669,Positive,0.0273972602739726,0.0547945205479452,0.0,0.1917808219178082,0.0547945205479452,0.3287671232876712,0.1095890410958904,0.0821917808219178,0.0136986301369863,0.0684931506849315,1,3,0.22812504,-0.3135119

That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are ""100 Calorie Packs"", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight.

The dog is supposed to pull the rope to get the treat out.  Well, my boy bypassed all that and within 20 minutes figured out he just had to tip the bottle to get the treats out.  I put bigger treats in to keep him busy for longer and some pieces I still don't know to this day how he got them out before I got home from work.  My only gripe with this toy, which is something the instructions don't tell you, is that the rope starts to stink after a while.  I cleaned it with dish soap a few time but that was only a temporary fix.  Put the rope in the washer and it frayed and came loose.  I'm now using and old medium width leash that I cut and knotted up on both ends (small enough to still let the treats out but not to have him spill all at once), which will also be easier to wash since I don't have to worry about fraying.

"I opened the packages, and pulled out one of the biscuits.  They are shaped as two pieces that can easily be broken in half.  Each 1/2 piece is a bit large for training, I would prefer smaller bits, but the 1/2 piece makes a nice mouthful for a medium sized dog (45 lb).

She was hesitant at first, but gave in and attacked the treat with gusto.  Her normal behavior for getting a treat is to sit.  Once she finished the first treat, she got into the sit position, and stared intently at me and the bag, eager to earn another.  I gave her a second, and it was gone in moments.  I then placed her regular treat (a Milkbone) 2 feet apart from one of these treat, made the dog wait for 15 seconds.  When I let her go, she went first for the Newman treat.

In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding.

"I heard Maldon was supposed to have a wonderful taste. After using it for a while, my husband and I don't care for the tast so much. As far as the use of it, I was under the impression it was to be used in cooking, but heard later it was for garnishing on a finished plate. When added to a pan to saute, it takes alot longer to melt than kosher salt. Some of the thicker flakes never melt completely, so we get a mouthful of large salt flakes with some bites of our meal (which I don't like). Used as a garnish, it looks cool but again, it's way to salty and thick for me to eat. The flavor is a very clean, super salty taste- more salty than the other sea and kosher salts we use.

"The first sip gave a pleasing flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />When trying the kiwi flavor, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. ""100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.""<br /><br />2. ""Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.""<br /><br />3. The logo has ""THE"" placed upside-down and reversed, atop ""Switch,"" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)""<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI"">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that other flavors also have acerola in them).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink...

There is a world of difference between these two things.  An infusion is easily the best way to try truffle oils, truly meaning that genuine truffles were infused with a high quality olive oil.  An ""essence"", on the other hand, generally means it's been made to taste of white-truffles, perhaps even using very synthetic methods.  This brand could be both and as a general rule I trust Urbani products.  Still, for a simple and less expensive oil used for general cooking, this is good for its price-point.  I would generally recommend a truffle salt (with truffle shavings) for a more authentic truffle experience.",i bought this for my last birthday thanks to a gift card i was sent i should say that for its price this is a perfectly decent brand of white truffle oil i use it for making omelets sauteing vegetables and even as an ingredient for salad dressings if you like a garlicky white truffle flavor this is a good brand and can even make a good gift depending upon your budgetbr br there is a bit of confusion when i read about this online it says it is an infusion other places both online and by the manufacturers say it is truffleessence there is a world of difference between these two things an infusion is easily the best way to try truffle oils truly meaning that genuine truffles were infused with a high quality olive oil an essence on the other hand generally means its been made to taste of whitetruffles perhaps even using very synthetic methods this brand could be both and as a general rule i trust urbani products still for a simple and less expensive oil used for general cooking this is good for its pricepoint i would generally recommend a truffle salt with truffle shavings for a more authentic truffle experience,4,0.2059722222222222,Positive,0.0377358490566037,0.0188679245283018,0.0,0.2264150943396226,0.1132075471698113,0.2641509433962264,0.0188679245283018,0.0,0.0,0.1698113207547169,2,2,0.14985484,0.061373383

"I am a coffee lover. It is one of the few pleasures of my life so I was excited to review this product.  Once received I opened it up and gave a good sniff.  I know to some that may sound stupid, but I love to open coffee and have the aroma surround me, this coffee did not do that as much as others that I have used.  I had to really give a good sniff to smell the aroma, but it smelled pretty good once I got my nose in there.<br /><br />I set out to brew myself a pot.  I followed the directions and enlisted my husband to have a cup with me.  Now usually I do not drink decaffeinated, so I was just a little concerned. Decaf to me can taste very flat. But I waited and a nice smell filled the air.  Finally our coffee was ready and we both sat down to taste this product. My husband smiled. He loves any coffee that has Arabica beans. He looked at me and said, ""ummm this is really good.""  My turn.  I sniffed some more, I'm a real sniffer before anything goes into my body.  It still smelled pretty good so now for the taste test.<br /><br />Okay, it was definitely different than the Dunkin  Donuts coffee that I'm use to and love.

"This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various ""high end"" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the ""Before Grain"" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy ""Duck a l'orange"" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a ""treat"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing ""Made in Thailand"" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.",this variety pack came to us as an amazon vine program sample our two cats have been living on various high end dry cat foods for some time now eg the before grain foods in chicken tuna and salmon versions and some fancy pantsy duck a lorange stuff from our local pet shop they have not been partial to canned foods nor have i often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didnt seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods they typically start out loving canned food but after a few bites the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food theyve grown to lovebr br however both of our cats are smitten by this stuff it looks like real food out of the can with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth it doesnt have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something i could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch the ounce size makes it perfect for a treat for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish with some added hot water as they really love the brothbr br but im not sure i want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason i dont want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash im concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet seeing made in thailand emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the us or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials the chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mindbr br the discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern im also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans is it farm raised in thailand and if so under what conditions is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats gullets what about mercury and other contaminants in the foodbr br bottom line my cats seem to love the stuff but im not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again,3,0.0757096714654854,Positive,0.0306122448979591,0.0306122448979591,0.0,0.1632653061224489,0.0306122448979591,0.2959183673469387,0.1122448979591836,0.0408163265306122,0.0204081632653061,0.1836734693877551,0,4,-0.24942136,-0.09815924

"Small little bonsai. Arrived tightly package, but foliage was a little dry. Nothing a good misting couldnt fix. Only 3 or 4 inches tall but nicely shaped - looks as though it was trained with wire.

Also, it likes direct sunlight in the morning hours, but not during midday. I keep mine where it receives direct sunlight until about 1130am.

"Nabisco ""Big"" Wheat Thins taste great despite a name that didn't exactly excite me about trying them. They make great snacking crackers; and when you serve these to your guests you're gonna be loved by them forever! Hehehe<br /><br />The crackers are very low in fat; and there are no trans fats at all in a serving--hooray! These crackers contain no cholesterol and you do get 5 grams of whole grain in a single serving. Excellent! The crackers contain a relatively low amount of sodium which is more good news.<br /><br />Moreover, the crackers contain defatted wheat germ; this is very healthy for you.<br /><br />The extra large size of these crackers makes them particularly useful when you serve them with a dip to guests. Of course, you can also treat yourself to this same delight! They taste wonderful with a garlic and herb cheese dip I sometimes use.<br /><br />One small caveat: Eat these before any expiration date printed or stamped on the top of the box.

"Being the lone Celiac in the crowd makes for challenging entertaining. Most of the crackers I've had/served leave a fine dust coating on the pallet, or they have an aftertaste. This cracker does NEITHER. It's a little strong on the sesame flavor, but it really is a great cracker to serve with Alouette cheese, etc.  It was a real crowd pleaser at our holiday gatherings, and several non-Celiac family members and friends now keep it on hand in their pantries just because of the taste. One of the things that I just couldn't keep plated was when I put a little garlic/onion cream cheese on one of these crackers and topped it with a tidbit of smoked salmon. ;-) The only bad thing (and the first reason I won't give it 5 stars) is that the cracker gets soggy if you plate the stuff even just 30 minutes before serving, so you really have to make it as needed, or let it be self-serve/assemble.

"This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant. It's much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way, with a lot of water and a bit of milk. This is very creamy and tasty. My only criticism is that there aren't enough sachets in the box. Only 10.

"Well I bought these to have a ""Food Tripping Party"" with my wife. I had a spread before us of lemons, limes, strawberries, blackberries, oranges, and grapefruit. We both started with half a pill each as per the reviews here. I then took a bite of a lemon. I guess is was sweeter but not by much, though I was able to eat it. It was like a sweet + tart food which I guess is because of the acid in the fruit. I then ate another half of pill because the instructions that came with the pills stated to take a full one. I tried again. It made the lemons bearable but not super sweet. You would not be able to eat an entire be happy. I went onto the other fruits and the same thing. You could still taste the tart with a sweet aftertaste. My wife said this, ""Well it makes it so you can eat lemons, but who wants to sit around eating lemons all day?"" I'm disappointed BUT the price was cheap enough and it was a fun thing to do with my wife. I'll pawn these off on friends and see what they say.

"These are very very good tasting. Crispy cookies, especially delicious when dipped in milk. They say gluten free, and I totally believe they are, because I did not have a wheat-type reaction. But, I have to say, I always feel MISERABLE after eating these cookies.<br />Someone else mentions how they are too sweet, etc etc. I don't think they taste too sweet, and they have 13g of sugar per serving which doesn't seem like it's that much, considering most other 'sweets' have more sugars per serving (take a look at Gatorade, for example).<br />That said, it does seem to be some kind of a reaction to the sugar, because immediately after eating them I feel like my body is dumping into some kind of sugar coma. I start to feel like lead, and lightheaded. They also mess up my tummy. Maybe it's the type of sugar they use? Evaporated cane juice is the 1st ingredient, and they also contain 2 kinds of cellulose, which I think are sugars also (but I could be wrong).<br />Anyhow, I gave 4 stars for taste, because they are THAT good, but keep in mind you may feel like you need a lengthy nap to recover from eating them.<br /><br />I agree with the previous poster they should do *something* about this ... I don't want stevia or artificial sweeteners in them, but maybe try using less sugar, or a different kind of sugar, like organic brown? I have no idea, but I would never let a kid eat more than 1 of these at a time, for fear it'd make them just pass out!<br />I eat other sweet stuff, and nothing makes me feel this bizarrely over-sugared.<br /><br />I'm not even totally sure it's the sugar that makes you feel this way ... any ideas?

So, the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes. I do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that I have ever tried at home. Compared to the Swiss Miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it. I'm a big fan!",i ordered this wanting to try a hot chocolate on my keurig and i am very happy with this product i will definitely be ordering it again that being said i dislike hot chocolate made completely of water so i do add a splash of half and half to my cup when i make this thus i didnt want to give it a star rating since i do doctor my cup up a bit at home otherwise i would have however i wont even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water i use milk usually for those and they still dont measure up to this product from grove square so the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes i do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that i have ever tried at home compared to the swiss miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it im a big fan,4,0.2244444444444444,Positive,0.0217391304347826,0.108695652173913,0.0,0.1956521739130435,0.0434782608695652,0.1956521739130435,0.0652173913043478,0.0434782608695652,0.0217391304347826,0.1304347826086956,1,3,0.2595639,-0.03465402

"i get horrible gas, stomach pain and loose stools if I drink a glass of cow milk or eat in cereal. I have tried lactase pills and special milk with no results.<br /><br /> I use this instead and have none of those symptoms.  Measure into your mixing bowl, cup, pitcher, etc. and SLOWLY mix in HOT water. As soon as it's paste, you can add cold water.  Doing it this way prevents clumping.<br /><br />I like it and add JUST A TOUCH of sugar or other sweetner & kids can't tell the difference between this and cow milk.  I use 1 TBS of unsulphured, blackstrap molasses per 16oz milk. It turns the milk light brown (think iced coffee) but my family doesn't mind. We like the way it tastes and appreciate the extra iron, calcium and potassium from the molasses (has to be unsulphured, blackstrap). This type has only 11g carbs per TBSP.

"RECONSIDER THIS FORMULA!!<br /><br />Martek advertises this formula on their website!<br /><br />""Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing, they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted. Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents"".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be ""agricultural ingredients."" Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as ""necessary vitamins and minerals,"" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and ""other"" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from ""natural""<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe.

The patents explain that the oil is ""extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane.""<br /><br />The patent for Life'sARA states: ""genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid"" and ""extraction with solvents such as ... hexane."" Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!!

"My cat is addicted to Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys. It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens! When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him. After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food. First, I want it to have real ingredients listed. I don't like for it to have by-products. (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food) Second, I don't want it to stink. If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it. Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria. Next was the big question: would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off. He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting. Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior. He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day. I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn. It really looks like people food. He seemed to really enjoy the ""soupy"" broth. This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off. He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest. Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken. It smelled pleasantly like Asian food. His reaction was to sniff and wander off. After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food. So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor. I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM. It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day. A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior. He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits. I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily. Clearly, my kitty has preferences. I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)) that are available on Amazon. He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past. It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand. I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance. That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general. The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup.",my cat is addicted to fancy feast elegant medleys it doesnt matter if i buy him expensive or cheap alternatives he wont touch it unless it has those garden greens when i saw the new offerings from petite cuisine i decided to give it a try with him after all they have some veggie content which i figured might appease his tastesbr br there are a few things i look for in a wet cat food first i want it to have real ingredients listed i dont like for it to have byproducts ffem does but hes addicted so i suppress my concern by giving him greatforhim dry food second i dont want it to stink if it turns my stomach when i open a can i dont care how much he likes it im not serving it third it needs to come out of the can easilybr br petite cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria next was the big question would my addict take to this new brandbr br with ffem my cat usually begs for it sniffs it and then wanders off he returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting occasionally he will wolf it down immediately so consider that the baseline behavior he has selffeeding access to dry food and he gets a oz can of wet food at most twice a day sometimes he doesnt seem to want the second canbr br i fed him his first petite cuisine can from this box in chicken pot pie flavor as his second feeding for the day i was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real im assuming pieces of carrot and corn it really looks like people food he seemed to really enjoy the soupy broth this was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off he came back later in the evening and finished off the rest successbr br the next day i started him with a can of the sesame chicken it smelled pleasantly like asian food his reaction was to sniff and wander off after hours he hadnt touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food so he was clearly hungry but didnt want to touch this flavor i washed the remains away and gave him a can of ffem it was gone within a minutebr br so i wondered if hed just been particularly hungry on the pot pie day a few mornings later i did pot pie for the morning feeding and i observed the same behavior he drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits i also retested the sesame chicken on a day when i knew he was hungry and he ignored it steadily clearly my kitty has preferences i have tried some other petite cuisine flavors petite cuisine variety pack yellowfin snapper tuna sole tuna shrimp for cats ounce cans pack of that are available on amazon he will chow down on tuna shrimp flavor but generally doesnt seem to like the other seafood pc flavors though he will eat them if left with them unlike the sesame chicken reactionbr br my point is that my cat is picky and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though hes rejected many highquality foods in the past it is nice to have an alternative to the one brand im also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scentbr br i do want to addnote that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance that is definitely true for the pot pie flavor but it is not true for petite cuisine in general the pot pie is definitely made to resemble soup,5,0.0552415177415177,Positive,0.055045871559633,0.0091743119266055,0.0,0.1834862385321101,0.036697247706422,0.3027522935779816,0.091743119266055,0.0091743119266055,0.0275229357798165,0.1834862385321101,0,4,-0.1622261,-0.116004

"Since a lot of allergy issues stem from what dogs are being fed, this is an excellent treat for your allergy prone dog.  You'll know them by their skin and ear issues.  While most dog treats remind me of beef jerky, these actually remind me of wheat granola bars.  They are medium sized bars that are scored in the middle so you can break them in half.  I have 3 dogs of all sizes:  110lb Chocolate Lab, 15lb Miniature Pinscher, 1lb Chihuahua.  All three dogs love this treat.  I give the whole piece to the Lab and then break another in half and give 1 half to the MinPin and the other half to the Chihuahua.  The first two devour this treat in seconds but it takes the Chihuahua half a day to make it through the treat.  I think that's good.  It gives him something to do and it'll clean his teeth too.  The treat is very crumbly if they break it apart.  My dogs always clean up the crumbs afterwards, but probably shouldn't feed this treat to them on the carpet.

"I was looking for a wheel. You know, like the one sitting at the bar at a restaurant. I wanted to offer some broken pieces along with olives, pepperoni, and some prosciutto.  All for a New Years eve party. Well it was not a wheel - thank goodness because it was half a wheel and at 20 pounds for the half wheel, 40 pounds would have been way too much. The flavor was excellent, just enough of bite.  The creaminess of the cheese really came through and was a perfect balance. I broke up the half wheel into thirds and decorated a tray with a cascading effect of broken pieces. It was all well received with the choices of red wine. There was more than enough, which has allowed me to enjoy the flavors for other favorite dishes for a couple of more weeks. I am looking forward to ordering this again - Super Bowl is right around the corner. It is big, so make sure you can carry and store this quantity.

"McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.

It is sturdy enough to be enjoyed with milk or sweetener, yet has little harshness when consumed black.<br /><br />Twinings of London was founded in 1706, and is known internationally for marketing teas of consistency and value. Twinings English Breakfast Tea was originally blended to complement the traditional, hearty English Breakfast, from which its name derives. Twinings literature tells us that this is a blend of Kenyan and Assam black teas.<br /><br />Tea enthusiasts generally prefer loose tea to tea bags which contain less expensive, smaller particles and the ""fannings"" or ""dust"" remains from processing of loose leaf tea. Moreover, you can sometimes taste the paper used in bags, especially in the weaker teas.<br /><br />However, this Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses only small particles that infuse more quickly than whole leaves. This blend approaches full strength within just a couple minutes. To avoid excessive particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)<br /><br />This product is a fine introduction to the world of loose tea.

"The first thing you notice when you open a tin of Twinings Lady Grey<br /><br />(beside the redolence of bergamot oil mixed with the aroma of black tea and lemon which is a staple of the *Earl* Grey Teas) is the striking visual pattern of the loose tea:<br /><br />Dark dry tea leaves sprinkled with bright dots of dry orange peel and stunningly-blue cornflower petals.  It is almost as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds. Milder and less caffeinated than the Earl, this mix has become a permanent inhabitant of our pantry and our tea cups for almost 5 years now.<br /><br />Note that unlike Earl Grey, *Lady Grey* seems to be a Trademark of the Twinings Co.  If you are looking for a similar tea that is not manufactured by Twinings, you may have a hard time figuring what is the exact equivalent.  For example, some other companies market a blend called ""Pouchkine"" or ""Afternoon Earl Grey"" which essentially are milder versions of the traditional Earl Grey and lack some proprietary Twinings-only ingredients (most notably, the cornflowers).",the first thing you notice when you open a tin of twinings lady greybr br beside the redolence of bergamot oil mixed with the aroma of black tea and lemon which is a staple of the earl grey teas is the striking visual pattern of the loose teabr br dark dry tea leaves sprinkled with bright dots of dry orange peel and stunninglyblue cornflower petals it is almost as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds milder and less caffeinated than the earl this mix has become a permanent inhabitant of our pantry and our tea cups for almost years nowbr br note that unlike earl grey lady grey seems to be a trademark of the twinings co if you are looking for a similar tea that is not manufactured by twinings you may have a hard time figuring what is the exact equivalent for example some other companies market a blend called pouchkine or afternoon earl grey which essentially are milder versions of the traditional earl grey and lack some proprietary twiningsonly ingredients most notably the cornflowers,5,0.0535897435897435,Positive,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5333333333333333,0.2,0.1333333333333333,0.0666666666666666,0.0,4,0,0.25235176,-0.11349369

"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time.<br />I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank.<br />He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it!<br />I give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz Felidae grain free food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will eat anything I give him :-)). I bought some can lids at Petsmart, and they seal air tight on these cans - so fridge storage is clean and easy.<br /><br />He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy - we haven't had a single vet visit since I adopted him (even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when I got him, they all cleared up). I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).<br /><br />I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or two of one) at the same time)!

"I ordered the 6 month ice cream of the month club for my wife's birthday.  She received her first shipment today and none of the 4 ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams (you could have bought several of the ice creams, such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip, in your local grocery store).

"These SAHLEN'S SMOKEHOUSE HOTDOGS are ""Totally Yummy"".  They have a lighter flavour than the all-beef hotdogs I am used to....and are NOT as unduly salty!  The delicious smoked taste is there, all right -- but it is NOT overpowering, and will NOT burn your tongue!  Just a nice, subtle flavour.  And this all means not only are they delicious, but also that you won't go looking for gallons of water, (or soda, or whatever), after you eat a few.<br /><br />These are BIG, substantial hot-dogs.  If you want yours in a hot-dog bun, it will probably not only fill the bun, but some of the hot-dog will stick out at either end!<br /><br />If you wnat to take the ""wrapping"" (skin), off the hot dog, this is NOT easily done -- but then, it's not easily done with any of the OTHER hot dogs I've ever tried, either.  BUT -- it is EASIER to take off at least PART of the plastic wrapping -- and JUST the plastic wrapping, leaving the hot-dog itself, totally intact -- with thes Sahlen's Smokehouse Hotdogs, than it has EVER been my experience with any other hot-dogs.  (Maybe if I had more patience, I would indeed have been able to take more of -- or even all of -- the plastic wrap off.  But these hot-dogs are SO yummy, such will, I fear, never be the case!)<br /><br />These hot-dogs are conveniently wrapped two together -- so you will NOT be taking the entire contents out, when you want just one, or two.  At least, you won't do this inadvertently.  But -- once tasting these delightful hot-dogs, you may be sorely tempted to do this deliberately....<br /><br />................>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>...................<br /><br />On one of Oprah Winfrey's earliest programs, she and some guests went to a very<br />elite restaurant -- SPAGOS.

This makes Spago's pizza the ""non plus ultra"" of pizzas, I'm sure!<br /><br />For ""non plus ultra"", (absolutely NO better) hot-dogs, SAHLEN'S SMOKEHOUSE HOT-DOGS, just HAVE to be the ones.  Sahlen's has been making, (and probably, perfecting), hot-dogs, since 1869, (140 years).

"I've long been a fan of flavored coffees so when we got our Keurig brewer we jumped on the opportunity to sample as many different flavors of k cups as possible.  Our first foray into the single-serve hazelnut world was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZKI"">Gloria Jean's Coffees,Hazelnut K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, which was absolutely awful.  We've always enjoyed hazelnut coffee in the past, though, and vowed not to give up.  I ordered a sample pack of Wolfgang Puck's hazelnut directly from Keurig's website and hoped for the best.<br /><br />Thankfully, Hawaiian Hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water.  It is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming.  The hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut, which you'd think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted, but we've been disappointed in the past.  I'd never tried coffee from the Wolfgang Puck brand before, but our positive experience with Hawaiian Hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied, which is nice, but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found.

"We enjoy our morning coffee and, years ago, bought an espresso machine to stop paying so much money over to Starbucks.  Not only do we like coffee, but we know what we like and this isn't it.<br /><br />Flat bottom drip coffee makers use a medium grind to brew a perfect cup; while cone filtered drip pots can use a fine grind.  However this coffee is ground, according to the package, extra fine.  This type of grind is typically used in espresso machines, not drip coffee makers.  I have to wonder how much the grind affects the flavor of this coffee.<br /><br />The flavor is smooth, and non-acidic, while at the same time bland and forgetful.  We usually use a tablespoon of grounds per cup.  We tried the two teaspoons, as recommended on the package, which resulted in a weak cup of coffee.  Using our norm, the coffee had more flavor, but wasn't good.<br /><br />The only good thing about this coffee is using the used grounds in the garden.  I'm seriously thinking of soaking the remaining grounds so I can toss them in the garden.

So, I'm not sure how reliable a source I am, because our 15-pound mutt is a little closer to the former category: if it's not bigger than her head, then she'll try to eat it. So, yes, she loves the few of these we've given her so far. They are hard (Milk Bone kind of hard), smallish dry squares that take some effort to break in to small-dog bite-sized pieces, so they test our dog's jaws a little, but her tastebuds don't seem to complain either. Frankly, I like having a treat a dog can't consume in 2 seconds, it's good when she has to work at it a little, both to keep her occupied and to give their teeth and jaws a little workout. Having said that, smaller dogs, weaker-jawed dogs (puppies or the elderly) might not be willing or able to make the effort unless you mash the treat with a hammer or soak it in water or broth for a minute... and why waste your time, just buy a different treat, right?<br /><br />As usual, there's some cute fanciful text on the packaging, and like all Newman's Own products, the net profits go to charity.

When you open the bag, you catch a big whiff of how strong they are.  They're probably real flavorful because of it (I didn't try one).  The Wellness treats seem a little dryer.

After a lot of trial and error (with just water!) I figured out how to make these handy self-fill coffee pods NOT leak all over the place.

It's rigid enough and stays upright and fine when you brew. You really need to create a seal with the lid. Leaving the filter hanging out breaks the seal and allows liquid to seep out.,after a lot of trial and error with just water i figured out how to make these handy selffill coffee pods not leak all over the place the secret is to shove the filter all the way into the pod and not snap the lid over the edge of the filter make sure the filter is all inside its rigid enough and stays upright and fine when you brew you really need to create a seal with the lid leaving the filter hanging out breaks the seal and allows liquid to seep out,5,0.2194444444444444,Positive,0.0476190476190476,0.0952380952380952,0.0,0.1904761904761904,0.0,0.238095238095238,0.238095238095238,0.0952380952380952,0.0476190476190476,0.0476190476190476,1,3,0.1807485,-0.3263139

"Nutritional benefits of Chia seeds are amazing. Here are a few to start:<br /><br />*According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia, it also tastes very good. My girlfriend and I make a big pot of ""steel cut"" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of chia powder, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it. Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite.  I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days.  One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven't put in 500 miles.  But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon!  Could the Chia have helped?

"UPDATE June 2009: They changed the recipe so these are now more tender (good thing), but they got rid of the slight tangy vinegar flavor. Now they don't taste like chicken wings; just spicy chicken jerky. I will probably buy these about once a year now, instead of 1-2 times per month. Back to the Jalapeno jerky, when I can find it!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW from 11/29/08: I don't eat chicken wings that often any more (90 fat calories per wing, being deep fried and dipped in butter). And I LOVE chicken wings! But if the flavor you crave is that hot sauce & vinegar comingling with a large chunk of tender chicken, then give these a try. If you're looking for the butter, crispy or chewy skin, and deep fried flavor components, then you won't have those here. I don't buy beef jerky anymore (which is also a favorite), I buy these!

"I found this at Wholefoods for $2.50 and bought it mainly because of the cute bottle design. I had tried acai berry drinks before and aren't crazy about their flavor, and this doesn't change that. This product has a taste that reminds me of Chinese medicine. White tea is already by itself very subtle. The combination of white tea, lemonade, and acai juice just doesn't work together. I also found it overly sweetened (28g sugar in the bottle). One bottle is 140 calories.<br /><br />In addition to white tea, acai juice, cane sugar and lemon juice, it has soy lecithin.

Its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed.  I don't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants.

Smells a bit off but the taste is just fine.  Make sure to seep it for 10-15 mins or it won't work.  Give it about 10-20 mins to kick in.  Seems to last for 3-4 hrs.

"Pro-Treat Freeze Dried Liver Dog Treats / B000255OIG<br /><br />This is the sort of product that makes me wish I could give more than 5 stars... My puppy absolutely adores these liver treats - our dog trainer calls them ""puppy heroin"". With these treats, training becomes an absolute snap, since the puppy is willing to do anything for his smelly liver treat - and you will have his undivided attention during the entire training session.<br /><br />These liver treats come in cubes and slices about a half inch on each side. I slice them thinly three or four time lengthwise, and then again two or three time crosswise. The liver treats fracture easily, and the taste is so addicting that only the tiniest slivers are necessary to reinforce good puppy behavior. These treats are also low fat and low preservatives, so they are very healthy for your puppy and that makes them even more perfect for training.

"Patak's sauces have many uses but I always make a basic chicken curry.  A friend from India taught this recipe to me, and now I always have a jar or two on hand.  If you want you can get one of the Indian pickles/relishes as a garnish.  This is easy but is a bit time consuming with all the dicing and sauteing.  Typically the recipe as written takes an hour or so from start to finish, and serves 3-4 adults.  I always make at least a double batch; it's just as easy and that way I have leftovers to freeze and everyone can have plenty to eat.

I do not let anything caramelize.<br />6. Add chicken/yogurt mixture.  Saute a few minutes until chicken is about half cooked through.  Lower heat to low.<br />7. Add tomatoes and let simmer until the juices cook down a bit, and chicken is cooked through.<br />8. Add peas for color.  Add salt to taste.<br />9. Serve over freshly cooked basmati rice.

This Spicy Chicken flavor bowl of noodle soup would be the first instant variety of their noodles I've tried.<br /><br />The quality/texture of the noodles is similar to that of the Nissin brand noodles (better than Maruchan).  What sets this apart is the soup base flavor pack which delivers a more complex flavor and IMO tastes much better by comparison.  Since they give you the soup base pack, it gives you the option to add as much or as little flavoring as you'd like (whereas Cup O' Noodles, you're usually stuck with however much they give you).  It has the usual dehydrated veggies.  Other reviewers mention that there are little chunks of chicken... Reading the ingredients, I don't see a single mention of chicken besides chicken broth.<br /><br />Whereas the typical Cup o' Noodle will deliver 2.25-oz of unhealthy goodness, these bowls of noodle delivers 3.03oz.  The bowl of noodles wasn't that filling -- it'd be a perfect sized snack.  I don't know how they would conclude that this bowl would be equivalent to 2 servings.  The bowl delivers 380 calories (120 from fat), 14g of fat, 6g of saturated fat, 1780 mg of sodium, 56g of carbs, 2g of dietary fiber, and upwards of 2g of sugar, and 8g of protein.<br /><br />On the packaging, it seems NongShim is trying to sell you on the product being healthy.  It touts ""No MSG added,"" ""30% less sodium than our regular product,"" ""0g trans fat.""  It has received some ""2011 Chef's Best Award"" and is ""Endorsed by Professional Chefs.""  Really?<br /><br />If you're buying this, don't expect this to be your answer to a healthy diet.

"Another delicious old fashioned Boylan Bottleworks flavor of soda. I say old fashioned because they are a 100 year plus company that makes their sodas the way that everyone made them before they changed all the ingrediants in the 1970's. Their Black Cherry's deep flavor comes from a blend of different cherries along with other high class ingredients here. This is the only cherry soda I know that uses only a mix of pure natural black cherries for the flavor, no other fruit juices or artificial flavors mixed in to save money. As a result the cherry really does taste like cherry rather than a syrupy mess that has a hint of cherry. It has an authentic tart cherry mixed in the sweet, and you can taste the tart in the aftertaste. It even has a nice texture in the mouth. I know this sounds gushy but you have to try it!<br /><br />But it gets better, they used real cane sugar instead of the cheaper high fructose corn syrup that is used in all the big brand sodas. As a result the sweet is more clean, not as overpowering or syrupy. The carbonation is medium, again here is an issue of too much carbonation can detract from the flavor. Caffeine free. The bottle is very cool and nostalgic with a painted on label and raised letters on the glass, reminding you they have been in business since 1891.

"With the departure of Starbucks coffees, I reluctantly switched back to the other t-discs carried by local stores. I tried, I really did. But, it seemed like every other one I tried, which was basically every other one made, including the European t-discs, were not rich enough to satisfy me. I finally gave up and went back to an old fashioned drip coffeemaker so that I could make a nice, rich cup. I was still frustrated by the waste, since I'm the only coffee drinker in my home. Plus, being a basically lazy person, I didn't enjoy filling the reservoir every time I wanted to brew a pot, washing the pot out afterwards, or cleaning out the grounds from the filter.Recently, Tassimo/Gevalia came out with a dark house blend. The front of the package noted: ""New! If you like Starbucks House Blend, try this!"" As a last shot attempt before packing up my Tassimo for storage, I purchased this new t-disc coffee. Tasting my first sip, I was so HAPPY. Really really HAPPY! My coffee is so important to me, and the Gevalia Dark House Blend is AMAZING!!!!

Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE: I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth's Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.

"I love this sampler of Ghiradelli Chocolate Intense Dark Squares especially now that nutritionists recommend you have an oz. of dark chocolate each day that is over 70% cacoa.  Chocolate is a vegetable a friend reminded--it's a bean!<br /><br />These chocolates are affordable, tasty, rich, intense, silky smooth and just the right size.  I love to serve them for after dinner.  The squares are fairly large and individually wrapped.  It's great to have different amounts of cacoa depending on guests' tastes.  Dark chocolate is an acquired taste for some.  Of course, the darker the chocolate, the healthier so you can work your way up to the 86% cacoa. Great to have on hand for the holidays.

"I also reviewed the Jones Soda Berry Pomegranate vitamin water and that one fell short because it was mostly water and sugar and cost over $1 per bottle.<br /><br />The Switch Orange Tangerine is much better in my opinion in terms of flavor. It's also carbonated up quite a bit and has added ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) which gives it a lot of tang/bite. For me it isn't unpleasant at all - I like it.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviews, I don't get the medicine aftertaste. It's just a good, refreshing, carbonated drink. I tried this after getting in from a fairly warm bike ride and it does a pretty good job of quenching thirst. I tried it straight from a room temperature can and over ice and both were great. I like it over ice better, though. Then, just for fun, I added some Malibu rum to see how it was as a mixer and it's not bad. I won't be asking for it at a bar, but it gets the fruity flavor with the coconut rum and I think if someone was creative, this could be a match made in heaven.<br /><br />The down side (to me) is this is another fairly pricey drink. The cans aren't full-size cans either. So for almost $1 per can you get a smallish 8.3 ounces but with regular sodas you get 12 ounces - half again as much. Of course, sodas aren't 100% juice either.<br /><br />Upshot is if I'm on a beach somewhere and hot and thirsty, I'd probably buy this. For stocking at home, I'll stick with regular frozen orange juice or orange juice in a carton. I would recommend trying it for yourself, though.

"The biggest argument I have with Switch is that at a hair under $1 for each 8.3 oz can, it's awfully expensive.  I probably could overlook that if Switch was really, really delicious, but frankly it's not.  The orange-tangerine blend lacks the zip and character of those citrus fruits, particularly tangerine and its delicate sweetness.<br /><br />Instead, there's a heavy taste of the apple-grape combination of juices that forms the fruit base.  There's no added sugar, no high fructose corn syrup or any other sweeteners save the apple and grape concentrates, and that's fine, I'd prefer my juice to not have added sweeteners.  In my opinion, juice doesn't need to be sweetened.  I suspect that the fruit concentrate combo is cheaper than making the drink out of pure citrus juice, so I wonder why it's as expensive as it is.<br /><br />What makes me scratch my head is the notation ""Contains soy.""  What?  Why?  Why on earth put soy in a fruit juice cooler?  Honestly, I'd buy some seltzer or carbonated water of some sort and mix it with my own fruit juice before I'd buy Switch.  But if you'd rather have it pre-made, then by all means give it a try.

"I don't know how to describe 'Switch Orange Tangerine' without sounding like a cliche advertising slogan, but the truth is it REALLY IS very refreshing.  Just the right amount of carbonation too.  This stuff tastes like what you would get if you squeezed part tangerine and part orange and then poured in a bit of sparkling soda.  Very fresh tasting.  Not too sweet at all.  The label says there is no sugar added.  Fine, as it doesnt need any.  The label also says it has Apple and Grape juice. I taste mostly the tangerine myself but you may find your mileage varies.  Finally, it is supposed to give you a full days worth of vitamin C.  Ok,a LOT of drinks can do that nowdays, but without any refined sugar of high fructose corn syrup? (or artificial sweetener?)
